Post-cancer treatment, patients may experience reduced sexual desire and physical changes, such as hair loss, weight fluctuation, and bladder or bowel control issues. Long-term effects include difficulty maintaining an erection for prostate cancer survivors, and vaginal dryness due to radiation or hormone therapy in women.  Despite these changes, maintaining sexual intimacy is encouraged, with suggestions such as exploring non-sexual physical closeness, open communication, and experimenting with different arousal methods. Suggestions for discomfort include using lubricants for vaginal dryness and prescription medications like sildenafil and tadalafil for men to improve blood flow to the penis. For women experiencing pain during sex, a vaginal dilator is suggested.  Medical devices are also discussed, including vacuum erection devices and penile implants for men and vaginal dilators for women. For those who've had body alterations due to cancer treatment, the document encourages open discussion about how these areas should be treated during sex. Patients with ostomy bags, for instance, are advised to conceal the bag during sex if it causes embarrassment.  The document also emphasizes psychological support, encouraging patients to seek advice from medical professionals, counselors, or sex therapists.

It was formerly called sensory integration dysfunction and is not recognized as a separate medical diagnosis currently. Symptoms of SPD can range from oversensitivity to undersensitivity to sensory stimuli, affecting one or multiple senses. The disorder is typically identified in children but can also affect adults, and it is often seen in developmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder.  The exact cause of SPD is not yet identified, but hypersensitivity to light and sound appears to have a strong genetic component. Brain activity in children with SPD is shown to be abnormal when exposed to simultaneous light and sound. Treatments for SPD, despite its lack of medical recognition, are commonly seen and managed by occupational therapists. The treatment approach is tailored to each child's individual needs and generally aims to improve their skills in areas they struggle with and acclimate them to stimuli they find difficult to tolerate.   One prominent therapy is the Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based model which involves the parent-child \"floor-time\" method. This therapy engages the child in a playful, challenging way to help them respond appropriately and function more normally. The therapy approach varies based on whether the child is overreactive or underreactive to sensory stimuli. The purpose is to help the child master important skills in relating, communicating, and thinking, and also to manage their sensory issues.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on children_s_health from the perspective of a doctor."}

Nausea symptoms can include vomiting, bloating, and loss of appetite, which can compromise the pill's effectiveness if vomiting occurs within 2 hours of ingestion. The pill's function is based on a combination of estrogen and progesterone hormones that prevent egg release, while thickening cervical mucus to inhibit sperm from reaching the egg. To mitigate nausea, patients can take the pill with a meal, use antacids and anti-nausea medications, maintain a consistent pill-taking schedule, consume light, bland foods, drink cold liquids, eat smaller meals slowly, rest after eating, and avoid spicy foods.

Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical exam and medical history. Lab studies of blood, urine, and stool help detect abnormalities that might indicate cancer. Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasound, and fiber-optic endoscopy help ascertain the cancer's location and size. Biopsies are often necessary for a confirmed diagnosis. If the diagnosis is positive, staging is performed to check if the cancer has spread.  Treatment options depend on the cancer type and stage and may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy. Supportive care is crucial to relieve pain and other symptoms, maintain general health, enhance quality of life, and offer emotional, psychological, and logistical support to patients and their families.  Exercise can help manage fatigue, muscle tension, and anxiety. Mind/body therapies, such as guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and counseling can alleviate side effects like pain, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety, improving the patients' quality of life.   While no diet has been confirmed to slow, reverse, or cure cancer, some complementary therapies like acupuncture, acupressure, and certain herbal remedies might help patients feel better though they do not claim to cure the disease. Homeopathic preparations may also ease the nausea, fatigue, and anxiety associated with cancer and its treatment.   Social support and spirituality also play a significant role in managing depression, fear, and anxiety associated with cancer.

The disease is common among young children and prevalent in the United States, with half a million cases annually. It's typically contracted through poor hygiene, with the bacteria found in human feces and easily spread through contact with contaminated objects, food, or water.   Symptoms primarily include diarrhea, potentially with blood or mucus, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal cramps, and tenesmus. However, not all infected individuals exhibit symptoms, though they remain infectious. In severe cases, dehydration, post-infectious arthritis, bloodstream infections, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and seizures may occur. These complications are rarer but can be serious, particularly for individuals with compromised immune systems.  Diagnosis typically involves a stool sample to identify the presence of Shigella bacteria, and further tests to determine the most effective antibiotic treatment if necessary. However, many Shigella bacteria are antibiotic-resistant, complicating treatment. The primary treatment for mild cases is rest and fluid intake; drugs that inhibit diarrhea or slow intestinal function can exacerbate the condition.  Prevention of shigellosis mainly involves good hygiene practices, such as thorough hand washing and avoiding contact with contaminated objects, food, and water.

The treatment plan is based on factors like cholesterol test results, age, family history of high cholesterol, existing health problems, personal preferences, and risk of developing heart disease. Normal cholesterol levels vary based on age and gender.  The first step to lower high cholesterol is usually heart-healthy lifestyle changes. This includes eating a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fats and high in omega-3 fats and soluble fiber, regular exercise, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, and losing weight if necessary. If these lifestyle changes do not lower cholesterol enough, medication may be suggested.  Medication may be prescribed if cholesterol levels remain high despite lifestyle changes. The most common are statins which reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. Other medications include ezetimibe which lowers the body's absorption of cholesterol, bile acid-binding drugs which help the liver use up excess cholesterol, fibrates which reduce triglycerides and boost HDL cholesterol, and niacin which reduces fats produced by the liver.

It is different from abortion-inducing drugs and will not affect an existing pregnancy. It is not meant to replace regular birth control methods, which are more effective, have fewer side effects, and cost less. Emergency contraception may be needed after unprotected sex, contraceptive failure, or sexual assault.  There are different options for emergency contraception. Most are pills, often referred to as the morning-after pill, which include hormone-based pills like Plan B and non-hormonal pills like Ella. Some regular birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception if multiple pills are taken at once. Another method is the Copper-T IUD, which needs to be inserted by a healthcare professional within 5 days of the sexual activity.  These methods work by delaying or stopping ovulation, blocking hormones necessary for conception, or preventing implantation of a fertilized egg. The effectiveness of emergency contraception can depend on factors like your age, body weight, and when you had sex. It is generally more effective the sooner it is used after sex.  Certain medications and supplements can interfere with the effectiveness of emergency contraception, so it's important to consult with a healthcare provider about any other drugs you are taking. Emergency contraception is widely available at drugstores, health centers, and doctors' offices, with some types requiring a prescription. The cost can vary.  Side effects are usually mild and may include nausea, mild stomach pain, and headache.

The Copper-T IUD is also a safe and effective method for after-sex pregnancy prevention. However, it's noted that Plan B One-Step starts to lose its effectiveness in women heavier than 165 pounds and isn't recommended for them. Instead, the Copper-T IUD is suggested.  Most women don't experience side effects after using emergency contraception, but if they do, they're typically mild and short-lived. Potential side effects include belly pain, cramping, breast tenderness, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and upset stomach. Later side effects may include spotting and changes to the menstrual cycle. Severe belly pain could indicate a medical emergency such as an ectopic pregnancy.  Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but require taking more than one pill at once, which could cause nausea. A prescription is necessary for this method. Another option is a pill called ulipristal, which also requires a prescription.  The Copper-T IUD is a small device inserted into the uterus within five days of unprotected sex. It can cause heavier periods and more cramping, but other side effects are uncommon. It's the most effective form of emergency contraception and can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years.  The document also provides tips for managing side effects, such as taking over-the-counter painkillers for headaches or cramps and small, frequent meals for nausea.

It's caused when the heart's electrical activity doesn't function properly, leading to an unpredictable heartbeat. This can strain the heart, potentially leading to heart failure, and increase the risk of stroke due to blood clot formation.   Certain illnesses, such as endocrine disorders, increase your risk of AFib. Endocrine disorders are conditions caused by unusual levels of certain hormones. They include diabetes and thyroid disease, both of which can affect the heart's rhythm. High or low levels of hormones produced by adrenal glands can also negatively affect the heart. Risk factors for AFib also include age, alcohol consumption, family history, high blood pressure, and other heart conditions.  AFib symptoms can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of a fluttering heart, fatigue, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and sweating. AFib can be present all the time or come and go. If it lasts longer than 7 days, it's called persistent AFib and requires treatment.  Treatments for AFib can include medications like anticoagulants to reduce blood clot risk, rate-control medications to control heartbeat, and rhythm-control medicines to restore a healthy heartbeat. Procedures like ablation and electrical cardioversion can also be used to treat AFib.   It's essential to consult your doctor if you have been diagnosed with an endocrine disorder or have changing hormone levels due to menopause or other reasons. This is because these disorders can increase your risk of cardiovascular problems, including AFib.

This condition can lead to blood pooling in the heart, forming clots that can potentially cause stroke.   Treatment modalities for AFib include medications, nonsurgical procedures, and surgery. Medications comprise blood thinners (e.g., Apixaban, Aspirin, Dabigatran, Enoxaparin, Heparin, Rivaroxaban, Warfarin), heart rate medicines, and antiarrhythmic drugs. These medications help prevent clots, control heart rhythm, and slow down heart rate. However, they may require regular blood tests for monitoring and may cause bruising or excessive bleeding.   Nonsurgical procedures include electrical cardioversion, where an electric shock is given to regulate the heartbeat, and catheter ablation, where a catheter is used to send electrical signals to destroy cells causing arrhythmia. There are two major types of catheter ablation: Radiofrequency ablation and Cryoablation.   Surgical ablation procedures include Maze procedure, mini maze procedure, and convergent procedure. These procedures involve making cuts in the heart to form scar tissue that stops abnormal signals. Another option is AV node ablation, which involves destroying the AV node to stop abnormal signals and then implanting a pacemaker.   Pacemakers are devices that monitor the heartbeat and stimulate the heart if it's beating too slowly. While it is a relatively minor procedure, it has some risks such as bleeding, infection, damaged blood vessels, or a collapsed lung.   Moreover, the management of AFib also includes treating the causes, such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, or an overactive thyroid.

Polio, an infectious disease caused by a virus living in the throat and intestinal tract, was once a leading cause of disability in the U.S. However, with the introduction of the Polio vaccine in 1955, the disease was eradicated in the U.S, though it still exists in some developing countries.   The Polio vaccination is primarily recommended for children, who receive four doses at various stages of their development, starting at 2 months and ending with a booster dose at 4-6 years. The oral Polio vaccine, used prior to 2000, was replaced with the inactivated Polio vaccine (IPV) due to the risk of the live virus causing a few cases of Polio per year. IPV is administered via injection in the arm or leg and is deemed safe for concurrent administration with other vaccinations.  Adults, especially those with a high risk of coming into contact with the Poliovirus, such as travelers to areas where Polio is common, laboratory workers handling Poliovirus specimens, and healthcare workers in close contact with potentially infected persons, are advised to consider the Polio vaccination.   However, those with severe allergic reactions to the Polio vaccine or certain antibiotics (streptomycin, polymyxin B, neomycin) and pregnant women are advised to avoid the vaccine if possible.

This condition causes strictures and fistulas in the area around the anus, leading to difficulty in passing gas or stool, and possible tunneling of sores causing pus drainage. Perianal Crohn's is indicative of severe Crohn's disease. It is challenging to treat and often requires surgery. Only about a third of those affected are in remission after a year on maintenance treatment.  Perianal Crohn's disease affects about 25% to 80% of adults with Crohn's and between 13.6% and 62% of children. It impacts a similar number of men and women, but women are at greater risk for further complications in the vaginal wall. Risk factors include genetics, gut bacteria makeup, ileitis, early Crohn's diagnosis, and more complicated disease forms.  There are three damage levels, including tissue destruction, abscesses with perianal fistulas, and rectal stricture. Symptoms vary among individuals, with some experiencing constipation, incontinence, infections, itching, and bleeding. While some patients experience mild symptoms, others can have severe symptoms impacting their quality of life.  A team approach involving a surgeon and gastroenterologist is required for diagnosis and treatment, which may involve an internal exam under anesthesia (EUA). Medication is crucial to induce remission, including immunosuppressive and biologic drugs. Nutritional therapy and experimental treatments, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and mesenchymal stem cell application, are currently being studied.  Effective management of perianal Crohn's requires a prompt diagnosis, ongoing follow-up, and attention to both emotional and physical needs.

High cholesterol can lead to arterial clogging, blood clots, stroke, or heart attack. Two main types of cholesterol influence cardiac risk: low-density lipoprotein (LDL or 'bad cholesterol') that increases cardiac risk when elevated and high-density lipoprotein (HDL or 'good cholesterol') that lowers cardiac risk by clearing LDL.   Triglycerides are another lipid that can harden arteries and lead to heart attack or stroke. Healthy lipid profile parameters include total cholesterol below 200 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL (or less than 70 mg/dL with heart disease, diabetes, etc.), HDL cholesterol above 60 mg/dL, and Triglycerides below 150 mg/dL.  There are two types of high cholesterol: primary (familial hypercholesterolemia) where LDL levels are genetically high, and secondary high cholesterol associated with lifestyle and health conditions like diabetes, heavy drinking, and lack of exercise. Treatments involve lifestyle changes for both types, and medication like statins, nicotinic acid, fibrates, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors, particularly for genetically high cholesterol.  High triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol may also be associated with an unhealthy lifestyle, certain health conditions, or genetics. Treatment usually involves lifestyle changes and medication if required.   The need for treatment is determined by the individual's cardiac risk, calculated using a formula considering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, race, sex, smoking habits, and family history of early heart disease. Individuals within certain age brackets and those with a low to intermediate cardiac risk or specific conditions may not require immediate medication.   Decisions about cholesterol-lowering medication are based on the individual's readiness to commit to lifestyle changes and their cardiac risk. In cases of unclear or intermediate cardiac risk, heart disease screening tests like coronary calcium scan or the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein blood test (hs-CRP) may be used to guide treatment decisions.

Smoking, exposure to sun and pollution, stress, gravity, and even our sleeping position can cause these changes. Some of these changes include our skin becoming rougher, developing benign tumors, losing its elasticity, becoming thinner and more fragile, and bruising more easily.  A loss of fat below the skin in our face may result in a leaner look, sunken eyes, and a \"skeletal\" appearance. Loss of bone, especially around the mouth and chin, can become evident and cause the skin around the mouth to pucker. The cartilage loss in the nose can make the nasal tip droop and emphasize the bony structures in the nose.  Sun exposure is a significant factor contributing to skin aging. It damages the skin's elastin fibers causing the skin to sag, stretch, and lose its ability to snap back after stretching. It also makes the skin bruise and tear more easily and delays the skin's healing process. While sun damage can sometimes be reversed with lasers and the skin can repair itself, the best approach is prevention. Using sunscreen with zinc oxide and an SPF of 30 or more, wearing clothing that covers the skin, and using sunglasses can help protect against sun damage.  Other factors like gravity, facial movement, and sleep position also contribute to changes in the skin. These can cause the eyebrows and eyelids to droop, loosen the skin under the cheeks and jaw, and lengthen the ear lobes. Facial movement lines and sleep creases become more visible as the skin loses its elasticity. Smokers tend to have more wrinkles than nonsmokers of the same age, complexion, and sun exposure history.  Lastly, dry skin and itching are common in old age and can worsen with anything that further dries the skin. If the condition is severe and affects your sleep or causes irritability, it's best to seek medical help as it may be a symptom of a disease. Certain medicines can also worsen the itchiness.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on healthy_beauty from the perspective of a patient."}

It's a major health issue, causing numerous heart attacks and deaths each year in the U.S.   There are risk factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease, some of which we can control, and others we can't. Factors we can't control include being male, older age, family history of heart disease, being postmenopausal, and race. However, there are also many lifestyle-related risk factors that we can control, like smoking, unhealthy cholesterol levels, uncontrolled high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, unmanaged stress, depression, anger, poor diet, and alcohol use.  Research suggests that heart disease can often be prevented by making lifestyle changes. These changes can also improve overall physical and mental health. Here are some suggestions:  1. Quit smoking: Smokers have a much higher risk of heart attack, and second-hand smoke can also increase your risk. 2. Improve cholesterol levels: You can do this through a diet low in cholesterol, saturated and trans fats, and simple sugars, and high in complex carbohydrates. Regular exercise can also help. 3. Control high blood pressure: This can be managed through diet, exercise, weight management, and if needed, medication. 4.

The American Heart Association recommends everyone over 20 to have a cholesterol test. The test measures your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, another type of fat. The document provides guidelines for what these numbers should ideally be.  If your cholesterol levels are too high, there are lifestyle changes and medications that can help. Changes include a diet low in saturated fat and simple carbohydrates, regular exercise, and quitting smoking if you do so. If these changes aren't enough, there are several medications available that can reduce cholesterol levels.  However, cholesterol isn't the only risk factor for heart disease.

For symptom relief, including burning, inflammation, and pain, OTC pain relief drugs like Acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen are typically recommended. However, these should be used judiciously in patients with heart issues, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver conditions, or other intestinal problems.  Antihistamines like Cetirizine, Chlorpheniramine, Diphenhydramine, Fexofenadine, and Loratadine may be beneficial in mitigating the itchiness associated with eczema. They function by inhibiting the effects of histamine but must be taken regularly over several weeks to be effective. However, they may have side effects like dry eyes or mouth, drowsiness, blurred vision, dizziness, low blood pressure, mucus production, increased heart rate, and gastrointestinal issues.  Topical hydrocortisone, a low-strength steroid, can help reduce inflammation, itching, and irritation, providing temporary relief from rashes. Side effects such as itching, burning, acne, dry or cracked skin, and changes in skin color may occur.  Medicated shampoos may help alleviate dandruff caused by eczema, with side effects like itching, stinging, burning, hair loss, scalp dryness, or oiliness, headache, changes in hair texture, and scalp boils being relatively rare.  Emollients can improve the skin barrier, helping to keep the skin hydrated and protected from irritants. They come in various forms like creams, ointments, lotions, gels, and sprays.

They work by introducing a weakened form of a disease into your body, which triggers an immune response. This helps your body to fight off the infection if you're ever exposed to the actual disease-causing organism in the future. Not only do immunizations protect us from serious diseases, they also prevent the spread of those diseases to others. Some vaccines need to be given only once, while others require updates or \"boosters\" for continued protection.  Immunizations are particularly important for children, as they can protect them from diseases that could cause serious health problems. A number of vaccines are recommended for children up to the age of 6, including Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, and others. It's important to keep your child's immunizations on schedule and up to date, but if a dose is missed, it can be made up later.  While vaccines are generally safe, they can have minor side effects such as soreness or redness around the injection site, or a low-grade fever. In rare cases, more serious side effects can occur, but the overall benefits of vaccines far outweigh these risks.  Despite their effectiveness, some misconceptions about vaccines exist. Some people question the need to vaccinate against diseases that are now rare, but it's important to remember that these diseases remain rare largely because of vaccines. Concerns have also been raised about the preservative thimerosal, although no harmful effects have been reported from its use in vaccines. Finally, while some people believe there's a link between vaccines and autism, numerous studies have found no such connection.  The document also mentions potential concerns about bioterrorism, but the CDC currently believes the risks to the public are low and hasn't made vaccinations for diseases like anthrax or smallpox available to the public.

The primary treatment approach is to address each of these conditions individually with lifestyle modifications and medications. Lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity, healthy diet, weight loss, and smoking cessation are key to managing Metabolic Syndrome. Exercise, even without weight loss, can enhance cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and improve insulin resistance. Dietary recommendations include a diet low in saturated fats, trans fat, cholesterol, and salt, and high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein, beans, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Mediterranean or DASH diets are often suggested. Weight loss is another primary goal, especially for overweight or obese patients. It's recommended to quit smoking as it greatly increases the risk of blood vessel and heart disease despite not being a direct risk factor for Metabolic Syndrome.  If lifestyle modifications aren't sufficient, medication may be necessary. These can include high blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers), cholesterol drugs (statins, niacin, bile acid resins, Zetia), diabetes medicines (metformin, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) for those with glucose intolerance, and low-dose aspirin to reduce the risks of heart attacks and strokes.

This condition manifests when all or part of the colon expands excessively, pushing toxic substances throughout the body. It necessitates immediate medical attention to prevent complications such as tears in the digestive tract, blood loss, and potentially fatal sepsis.  The most common precursor of Toxic Megacolon is Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), predominantly Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease. Both induce an overactive immune response resulting in inflammation of the colon. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, nausea, joint pain, fever, and skin rashes. However, Ulcerative Colitis only affects the innermost layer of the colon, while Crohn's disease can inflame all layers of the bowel and cause ulcers anywhere in the digestive system.  In less common scenarios, infections from a virus, bacteria, or even a parasite can result in toxic megacolon. Clostridioides difficile bacteria, campylobacter, salmonella, and shigella are common infectious agents. Certain illnesses or medications that inhibit blood flow to the bowel might also instigate the condition.   People with IBD, diabetes, kidney problems, a transplanted organ, or immune system issues are at higher risk. Symptoms include severe bloody diarrhea, fever, dizziness, a swollen abdomen, and rapid heart rate. Colon dilation is a classic indication of toxic megacolon leading to bloating and pain in the lower abdomen.  Diagnosis involves a comprehensive examination of symptoms, health history, X-rays or CT scans to examine colon dilation, and blood tests to identify infections or other potential issues.   Treatment depends on the severity of the condition, underlying causes, and patient's health status. Medications to treat the underlying condition, especially if it's IBD, include steroids and immune system drugs like infliximab or cyclosporine. Antibiotics are prescribed if the cause is an infection or in cases of ulcerative colitis. In severe cases, surgery may be needed to remove all or part of the colon.  The prognosis is generally good with a survival rate above 95% if the colon does not perforate or tear. Even with a tear, survival rates are around 80%.

Approximately 13% of individuals with hypothyroidism, a condition where the body doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones, also present high levels of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as bad cholesterol. Hypothyroidism is also associated with high triglyceride levels, increasing the risk for heart disease and stroke. Hyperthyroidism, though less common, may cause low levels of high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or good cholesterol.   Cholesterol, a waxy substance found in blood, is produced by the body and obtained from animal foods. Its types include HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Low HDL or high LDL levels, coupled with high triglyceride levels, can contribute to heart disease and other issues, including the narrowing and blocking of arteries leading to stroke and heart problems.   The thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, produces hormones that regulate metabolism. Hypothyroidism can lead to increased cholesterol levels, due to a slowed blood processing rate in the liver, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and potential arterial buildup.   Treatment of thyroid disease may improve cholesterol levels. Hypothyroidism is managed with thyroid replacement hormone medications, though these do not necessarily improve thyroid hormone levels. The document recommends adults with high cholesterol to get tested for an underactive thyroid. If cholesterol levels are not adequately reduced with thyroid replacement hormones, additional measures such as a healthier diet, regular exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medication may be recommended.

Surgery can be used to completely treat some forms of cancer, provide relief from pain, or serve other purposes. The type and number of procedures depend on factors like the type of cancer, its stage, and the treating team's plan.  The surgeries used in cancer treatment include:  1. Diagnostic or biopsy: A piece or the entire suspicious tissue is removed and examined to confirm if it's cancerous. 2. Staging: This helps to figure out the size of the tumor and how far the cancer has spread. It often involves the removal of nearby lymph nodes. 3. Curative: This involves removal of the entire tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue. This may be the only treatment required if the cancer hasn't spread. 4. Debulking: Partial removal of a tumor when full removal might cause damage. It's followed by other treatments like radiation therapy or chemotherapy. 5. Palliative: This surgery is not a cure but a way to ease symptoms and improve quality of life in advanced cancer stages. 6. Supportive: These procedures aid other types of cancer treatment. For example, a catheter may be inserted for easy medication delivery. 7. Reconstructive: This surgery takes place after the main one to restore the body's appearance or function. 8. Preventive: Some surgeries are done to lower the risk of developing cancer, like the removal of precancerous polyps in the colon.

Contrary to its name, heart failure does not mean the heart has ceased to function, but rather it is unable to pump blood efficiently. This inefficiency results from various potential causes, leading to a slower blood flow through the body and increased pressure in the heart. Heart failure can result from damage to the heart muscle due to coronary artery disease, heart attacks, cardiomyopathy, and overworking conditions such as high blood pressure, valve disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or birth defects.  Symptoms may vary from none to severe and may include congested lungs, fluid and water retention, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, rapid/irregular heartbeats, reduced exercise ability, persistent cough, rapid weight gain from fluid buildup, nausea, lack of appetite, difficulty concentrating, decreased alertness, and chest pain.  Diagnosis of heart failure involves medical history investigation, physical examination, and several tests including blood tests, B-type natriuretic peptide blood test, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, ejection fraction, electrocardiogram, cardiac catheterization, and stress test.  Treatment options have improved significantly and involve medication, lifestyle changes, monitoring, and in advanced stages, surgery (including coronary artery bypass grafting, heart valve surgery, implantable left ventricular assist device, and heart transplant). Medications used may include ACE inhibitors, Aldosterone antagonists, ARBs, ARNIs, Beta-blockers, Blood vessel dilators, Digoxin, Calcium channel blockers, Diuretics, Heart pump medications, Potassium or magnesium, Selective sinus node inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors.  The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have classified the stages of heart failure (A to D) to help understand its progressive nature. Further heart damage can be prevented by stopping smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, controlling high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and following recommended surgical procedures.  Patients with heart failure need to avoid certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, some antiarrhythmic agents, most calcium channel blockers, some nutritional supplements, antacids containing sodium, and decongestants like Sudafed.

The document reveals that smoking can increase the chance of getting Crohn's disease and make it more severe and harder to treat. It is also observed that smoking has a more significant impact on Crohn's disease in certain groups, notably those assigned female at birth and those with Crohn's in their ileum.   Several theories are presented about how smoking makes Crohn's disease worse. These include the increase of reactive oxygen species in the body due to the chemicals in smoke, which damage cells and impair their repair capabilities; the weakening of the immune system; the deterioration of the intestines' protective barrier; reduced blood flow leading to slower healing; and possible permanent genetic changes in the colon.  Smoking also affects the treatment of Crohn's disease. Smokers have more severe symptoms, more relapses, and may require more medicines or surgery. Post-surgery recurrence of Crohn's disease is also higher in smokers.   The document suggests that quitting smoking can significantly improve Crohn's symptoms and health in general. Within 6 months of quitting, the risk of a relapse or flare-up drops, and within 2 years, the disease progression aligns with that of a non-smoker.   E-cigarettes are noted as a potential concern, but their impact on Crohn's disease is yet to be confirmed by studies. While quitting smoking is the best option, those who struggle to quit should have closer medical monitoring and may require more intense treatment.

However, having too much cholesterol can lead to health issues, such as heart disease and stroke. This is because excess cholesterol can build up in the arteries, reducing blood and oxygen flow to the heart.   There are two types of cholesterol: \"good\" (HDL) and \"bad\" (LDL). HDL cholesterol is beneficial as it helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood, preventing its buildup in your arteries. LDL cholesterol is termed \"bad\" because when it's excessive, it contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease.   Doctors recommend that your total cholesterol level should be below 200 mg/dL. High levels of LDL (190 or above) pose a serious risk for heart attack and stroke. Conversely, a high HDL level is good as it helps to lower your risk for heart disease.   Factors that can increase your cholesterol levels include consuming foods high in fat, being overweight, and for women, going through menopause. However, you can lower your cholesterol levels by adopting a healthier lifestyle. This includes eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, exercising regularly, losing weight if you're overweight, quitting smoking, and taking prescribed cholesterol medication.   In terms of medication, cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors, bile-acid resins, niacin, and fibrates may be used. These medications are most effective when combined with a low-cholesterol diet.   Finally, it's important to get your cholesterol levels checked regularly. The process should begin from age 20 and be repeated at least every five years. If you have a family history of high cholesterol, you may need to get tested more frequently. If high cholesterol is a genetic issue in your family, your children may also need to have their cholesterol levels checked.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a patient."}

First line treatment includes dietary adjustments and increased physical activity. If these measures are inadequate, several classes of drugs may be prescribed, each with their unique mechanisms of action and potential side effects.   Statins are often the first choice, which lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and raise HDL cholesterol. Notable side effects include intestinal problems, liver damage, muscle inflammation, and potentially memory loss. They may interact with other medications, and grapefruit consumption should be avoided while on statins.   Bile acid resin drugs or bile acid sequestrants work in the intestines by binding to bile and preventing its absorption back into the blood, thus reducing cholesterol. Ezetimibe, another drug, reduces LDL cholesterol by blocking cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. Side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort and muscle or back pain.   PCSK9 inhibitors are used for those who cannot manage their cholesterol with lifestyle and statin treatments. They block the PCSK9 protein to facilitate LDL removal from the blood. Common side effects are itching, pain, flu-like symptoms, and skin reactions at the injection site.   Niacin, a B-vitamin, lowers LDL and raises HDL cholesterol, but evidence is lacking that it provides additional benefits when combined with statins. Fibrates reduce triglyceride production and boost HDL cholesterol. ATP Citrate Lyase Inhibitors, like Bempedoic, inhibit liver processing of cholesterol. Side effects include upper respiratory infection, muscle spasms, excess uric acid in the blood, and back or belly pain among others.   Prescription-strength Omega-3 medications can lower high triglycerides and reduce heart disease risk, but over-the-counter fish oil supplements are not recommended.   The document also emphasizes the importance of medication adherence and offers practical tips for managing medication routines, dealing with potential side effects, and ensuring that prescriptions are filled in a timely manner.

When taken correctly, they are up to 99.9% effective, however, they do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. The pills work by controlling the release of the egg from the ovary, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and changing the lining of the womb to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting. There are different types of birth control pills, including combination pills, extended-cycle pills, and minipills.   Combination pills use estrogen and progestin to stop the ovaries from releasing eggs. They regulate your period, lessen cramping, and can even help clear acne. Extended-cycle pills reduce the number of menstrual periods to only four a year. Minipills, which contain only progestin, are used by those who have side effects from estrogen.   Emergency contraceptive pills, also known as \"morning-after pills,\" can also be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex.   Birth control pills, while effective, can have side effects such as sore breasts, spotting between periods, mood changes, and mild headaches. In rare cases, serious side effects like blood clots, stroke, or heart disease can occur. It's important to consult with a doctor before starting any birth control regimen.   Birth control pills are generally safe for most people, but are not recommended for those over age 35 who smoke, or those with certain health conditions. Some medications can also make birth control pills less effective, so it's important to discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor.   The cost of birth control pills can range from $20 to $50 per pack, and they are usually packaged in 21 or 28-day packs. It's important to take the pill at the same time every day and always have a backup form of birth control in case you forget a dose. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember and use a backup form of birth control until you finish the pill pack.   Lastly, birth control pills do not affect long-term fertility. Once you stop taking the pill, your body will return to its normal cycle and you'll be able to get pregnant.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a patient."}

Here's the main advice:  1. Understand kids' exercise: Children tend to move in short bursts and in different directions compared to adults. Think of yourself as a playmate and engage in fun activities with them instead of structured workouts. This can include family games like tag.  2. Discuss the benefits of exercise: Explain to your child how physical activity can benefit other parts of their life. For example, it can improve concentration and focus, which can be beneficial to a child who enjoys studying.  3. Be creative: Find ways to integrate more movement into their daily routines without it feeling like exercise. For instance, parking further from the entrance at the mall or volunteering to walk dogs at a local shelter.  4. Understand their disinterest: Try to find out why your child doesn't like to exercise. It could be simple reasons like disliking sweat or deeper issues like bullying or health problems. If you're having trouble understanding, don't hesitate to seek professional help.  5. Start small: Encourage your child to commit to a small amount of exercise time, and gradually increase it. The goal is to make them feel good about achieving their exercise goals and inspire them to do more.  6. Change family activities: Introduce new family activities that involve movement like going to a trampoline park, rock climbing, or hiking. Kids, like adults, are more likely to continue with activities they enjoy.

There are two main methods of treating Crohn's disease: the 'step-up' method and the 'top-down' method.   The step-up method starts with milder drugs and moves to stronger ones if symptoms worsen. This method may start with drugs like aminosalicylates, which help to control inflammation and are usually used for mild to moderate symptoms. If the disease progresses, corticosteroids may be prescribed to calm your immune system and bring you into remission, meaning your symptoms will reduce or disappear. However, these are not usually used long-term due to potential side effects.   The top-down method, on the other hand, starts with the most potent drugs first, with the hope of halting the disease early. These include immunomodulators and biologics, which work to lower the activity of your immune system and reduce inflammation. If these don't work, your doctor may then try the less potent drugs.   Both methods have their pros and cons. The step-up method's main benefit is that it avoids over-treatment, but it doesn't necessarily repair the intestinal damage caused by Crohn's disease. The top-down method can achieve remission faster and may even repair intestinal damage, but there's a risk of over-treatment and these drugs can be more expensive.  Both methods also have potential side effects. Corticosteroids can cause a wide range of side effects from acne to high blood pressure, mood changes and weight gain. Immunomodulators can increase your risk of certain cancers and cause side effects like fatigue, liver damage, and nausea. Biologics can lead to allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, and increased risk of infections.  Your doctor will decide the best treatment approach based on your individual health situation and the severity of your Crohn's disease. It's important to remember that while there is no cure for Crohn's, the goal of treatment is to get you into remission and prevent symptoms from returning for as long as possible.

While the exact causes are not fully understood, factors like aging, heart disease, high blood pressure, thyroid disease, diabetes, kidney or lung disease, binge drinking, obesity, sleep apnea, and family history can increase the risk of AFib.   Interestingly, it is found that the condition is less common among Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations in America compared to white people, despite the fact that Black Americans have a lot of other risk factors that should increase their chances of AFib. This has been referred to as the 'AFib paradox'.   Studies looking at the prevalence of AFib among different racial groups with pacemakers have found that Black people had significantly lower AFib rates than white people. This finding suggests that the difference in AFib rates is not because the condition is missed more often in Black people.   Another study involving nearly 14 million people in California also found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian people all had lower chances of having AFib than white people. These differences were not as pronounced when comparing people of different races who all have more AFib risk factors. This suggests that white people might have additional risks for AFib that are not recognized or understood yet.  It is suggested that genetics may play a role in the prevalence of AFib. Some studies have pointed to changes or variants in certain genes that may influence a person's chances of AFib, with one study finding that white people more often carry one AFib variant linked to the condition.  Despite the lower rates of AFib in Black people, it's important to note that they still can get AFib. Another study suggests that if a Black individual does get AFib, they have a greater chance of complications, including stroke.

Cancer originates when cell division becomes unregulated, resulting in the formation of a tumor, which can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors do not metastasize or form new tumors, while malignant ones can invade healthy tissues, disrupt normal body functions, and induce nutrient depletion. They can grow directly or metastasize via the lymphatic or blood vessels, forming new tumors in different body parts.  Cancer encapsulates over 100 potentially lethal diseases impacting almost every body part. The main types comprise carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, lymphomas, and leukemia. Carcinomas, the most prevalent, originate in the skin, lungs, breasts, pancreas, and other organs and glands. Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, and leukemia is a blood cancer that usually doesn't form solid tumors. Sarcomas emerge in bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, cartilage, or other soft or connective tissues and are relatively rare. Melanomas develop in the cells that generate skin pigment.  Despite cancer being a long-recognized human disease, our understanding of its nature and progression is primarily a development of the past century.

Symptoms of hyperthyroidism can range from nervousness, increased sweating, sleep disturbances, and weight loss to palpitations. The symptoms of AFib include irregular heartbeat, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, and shortness of breath.  If these symptoms are present, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Diagnostic measures include a physical exam, blood tests to measure thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3 and T4 levels, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) to monitor heart electrical activity, an echocardiogram, stress test, and chest X-ray.  Treatment aims to normalize thyroid hormone levels and manage AFib to prevent stroke. AFib management may involve beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulants such as warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban might be needed.

This can impact nutrient absorption, digestion, and waste removal. Commonly, the ileum, the last part of the small intestine, is affected, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Other parts of the body, such as joints, skin, or eyes, can also be affected.  The disease varies in severity and location, from affecting a large part of the gastrointestinal system or only a small part, being mild, moderate, or severe, and having long periods without symptoms or frequent flare-ups. It can also go into remission.  Crohn's disease can result in local and systemic complications. Local complications include abscesses, bile salt diarrhea, fissures, fistulas, malabsorption and malnutrition, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and strictures. Systemic complications can include arthritis, bone loss, vitamin D deficiency, skin problems, eye problems, kidney problems, liver problems, and physical development problems in children.  The prognosis of Crohn's disease varies. Most patients will experience periods of disease activity followed by remission. Factors that might indicate a more severe course of the disease include being younger than 40, having perianal or rectal disease, initial treatment with steroids, smoking, and having a low education level. Up to 80% of people with Crohn's will be hospitalized at some point, and most will need surgery.  Despite these challenges, life expectancy with Crohn's disease can be close to normal with appropriate management and care. However, some patients may have a more aggressive form of the disease requiring more surgery and potentially reducing life expectancy.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

They can form in various areas including the intestines, bladder, bowel wall to skin, or between different parts of the gut. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the fistula and can include painful bumps or boils, frequent urinary tract infections, passing gas or feces through the vagina, red and sore skin, and diarrhea. Diagnosis is typically through physical exam and imaging tests.  The treatment of fistulas depends on their complexity. Simple anal fistulas may be treated with antibiotics in conjunction with standard Crohn's disease treatments such as anti-tumor necrosis factor agents like infliximab. More complex fistulas may require surgical intervention, with several options available including setons, medical plugs, fistulotomy, ligation of the intersphincteric tract, and medical glue. Alternatively, an ileostomy may be performed while the body heals from fistula surgery.  Experimental treatments using stem cells are also being studied, with a 2021 review suggesting higher rates of healing in patients given stem cell injections. Post-surgery, patients may require pain relief, stool softeners or laxatives, and close monitoring for recurrence or development of new fistulas. Crohn's disease control is crucial for fistula prevention, with nonsteroid therapies such as azathioprine or methotrexate and the anti-TNF drug infliximab showing promising results in reducing fistula incidence.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

This can lead to physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches, and can cause significant distress, affecting normal activities like going to school or playing with other kids. It commonly affects 4%-5% of children aged 7 to 11 in the U.S., and is equally common in boys and girls.   Common symptoms include an unrealistic and lasting worry that something bad will happen if they are separated from their caregiver, refusal to go to school or sleep without the caregiver nearby, fear of being alone, nightmares about separation, physical complaints, tantrums, and intense fear or guilt.   The disorder can be caused by a stressful or traumatic event in the child's life, overprotective parenting, having family members with anxiety or other mental disorders, insecure attachment to caregivers, stress, or having other anxiety disorders. It's also possible that children with separation anxiety disorder may also have obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression.  Diagnosis involves a doctor checking for signs and symptoms of the disorder and ruling out physical illness or medication side effects. If these are not found, a psychiatrist or psychologist may further evaluate the child.   Treatment is not always necessary for mild cases, but in more severe cases, or when the child refuses to go to school, it might be needed. Treatment aims to reduce anxiety, develop a sense of security, and educate the child and family about the need for natural separations. This could involve cognitive behavioral therapy (talking therapy), family therapy, medication, school intervention, and parents working with therapists to understand triggers and apply therapy techniques at home and school.   There's no known way to prevent the disorder, but recognizing and acting on symptoms early can ease distress and prevent problems. Reinforcing a child's independence and self-esteem may help prevent future episodes. Most children with this disorder improve, though symptoms may reappear during stressful times. Early treatment involving the whole family is usually the most successful.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on parenting from the perspective of a patient."}

This is particularly important for children as healthy habits formed in childhood can lead to healthier adults. Some children might resist drinking water, but there are ways to make it appealing. Parents can lead by example by drinking water themselves and avoiding sugary drinks. Making drinking water fun by using colorful straws, sippy cups, or creating a water station with drip-free pitchers can encourage children to hydrate. Adding fruit or herbs can enhance the flavor of water if your child doesn't like the taste. Always keep water easily accessible for your child and consider limiting sugary drinks and juices.  As per the American Academy of Pediatrics, children shouldn't have sugary drinks before the age of two and older children should only have juice if whole fruits are not available. Babies can start drinking water at six months, requiring only four to eight ounces as milk provides the rest of the hydration they need. Children aged one to three should have about four cups of either water or milk a day, which should be increased to five cups after they turn four years old, and seven to eight cups after their eighth birthday.

They could be substances in the air, products we use, or chemicals in our food and drinks. Exposure doesn't guarantee you'll get cancer; it depends on your genes and how much you've been exposed.  Tobacco is a known carcinogen with at least 70 chemicals that can cause cancer. This includes smokeless tobacco and passive smoking. If you're a smoker, consider quitting for health benefits.  Radon, a gas that can build up indoors, is a leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. It's advisable to test radon levels in your home for safety.  Asbestos, often used in construction, can cause cancer if its fibers are inhaled. If asbestos is present in your workspace or home, it should be removed professionally.  Certain foods, when cooked at high temperatures, can release a chemical called acrylamide which can cause cancer. You can reduce this risk by cooking food until it's tan, not golden or deep brown.  Formaldehyde, found in many household products, can cause cancer. Ensure your wood products or furniture don't contain this chemical and maintain good ventilation and humidity in your house.  Ultraviolet rays from the sun or tanning beds can cause skin cancer. Protect your skin with sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses, and avoid tanning salons.  High alcohol consumption increases your risk of several cancers, so limit your intake. Similarly, processed meats can raise your chances of getting colon cancer, so limit their consumption.   Engine exhaust, especially diesel, can increase the risk of lung and other types of cancer. Limit exposure to traffic and follow workplace safety guidelines if exposure is part of your job.

Newborns (1-4 weeks old) require 15-18 hours of sleep per day in short periods of 2-4 hours, with no established circadian rhythm. By 1-4 months, babies start to exhibit more regular sleep patterns, with the longest sleep periods lasting 4-6 hours.   Babies aged 4-12 months require 14-15 hours of sleep per day, but typically get around 12 hours. A key goal during this time is to establish healthy sleep habits. Daily naps decrease from three to two around 6 months and the baby becomes capable of sleeping through the night.   In the 1-3 years age bracket, children need 12-14 hours of sleep but usually get about 10 hours. By 18-21 months, most children drop the morning and early evening nap and only nap once a day.   Children aged 3-6 years require 10-12 hours of sleep per day, with most 3-year-olds still napping and most 5-year-olds not. Sleep problems are unlikely to develop after age 3.   Children aged 7-12 years need 10-11 hours of sleep, but due to social, school, and family activities, bedtimes gradually become later.   Finally, teenagers (12-18 years old) require 8-9 hours of sleep per day, although many may need more sleep than in previous years due to social pressures affecting sleep quantity and quality.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on parenting from the perspective of a doctor."}

There are also rare but very serious complications like the abnormal swelling of your colon and rupturing of your intestine, which may require surgery.   In some cases, individuals with Crohn's disease may have an increased risk of getting cancer in the small intestine or colon, though this finding isn't consistent across all studies. Other complications may affect your skin, joints, back, eyes, liver, bones, and bile ducts. For example, you may get painful red spots on your legs, skin ulcers around your ankles, eye conditions leading to vision problems, arthritis causing joint pain and stiffness, and inflammation of your liver or bile ducts.  In severe cases, a condition called sclerosing cholangitis can occur, causing narrowing and blockage of the liver's drainage ducts. This can result in yellow skin, recurring infections, and even liver failure. Sometimes, this condition necessitates a liver transplant and could also increase the risk of developing cancer in the bile ducts or gallbladder.

While it's not usually deadly, it's important to seek medical help if you suspect you have it. Some types can come and go on their own, but others may require treatment such as medication or medical procedures.  Symptoms of AFib can include changes in your heartbeat, fatigue, and trouble with exercise. If you have these symptoms, it's recommended that you contact your doctor, who may refer you to a heart specialist for diagnosis and treatment.  There are also emergency symptoms related to heart conditions. If you experience heart attack symptoms like chest pain, pressure or upper belly discomfort, or signs of a stroke such as dizziness, balance issues, vision problems, or trouble speaking, call 911 immediately.   AFib can sometimes lead to other issues such as bleeding, especially if you're taking blood-thinning medication. Look out for symptoms like memory loss, difficulty moving your limbs, severe head or stomach pain, and red blood in your stool or urine.  For managing AFib at home, mindful breathing and yoga can help calm your nerves and potentially reduce your heart rate. Regular exercise may also ease AFib symptoms and help maintain a healthy weight, which can lower your risk of AFib. However, always consult your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.  To prevent AFib attacks, avoid triggers like excessive caffeine, alcohol, stress, and lack of sleep. Keep your heart healthy with a balanced diet and an active lifestyle, and take any prescribed medication as directed by your doctor.

Lymph nodes are tiny organs that work to filter out harmful things in your body, including germs. By taking a small piece of your lymph node and examining it, doctors can diagnose or track the progression of diseases like cancer.   There are different types of biopsies. One is the Sentinel lymph node biopsy, typically used to see if a known cancer, such as melanoma or breast cancer, has spread. It involves injecting a radioactive substance or a blue dye near your tumor and removing the sentinel nodes, the first nodes cancer usually spreads to. This is done under general anesthesia and you'll likely go home the same day.   Another type is the Fine needle aspiration, similar to a blood sample draw but using a thinner needle to remove fluid and cells from a lymph node. If this doesn't provide enough information, other types of biopsies may be required.   The Core needle biopsy is similar but uses a larger needle to take a tissue sample, providing more information than just fluid and cells.   Lastly, there's the Open biopsy, which is more like surgery where all or part of a lymph node is removed through a cut on your skin.   Biopsies are generally safe, with minor bleeding and pain as possible side effects. Recovery time is typically quick, especially for Fine needle biopsies.   After the biopsy, the sample is sent to a pathologist who examines it under a microscope to look for abnormal or cancerous cells. The time it takes to get results can vary, ranging from the same day to up to 10 days or more, depending on the type of biopsy and the number of tests needed.

When you get vaccinated, your body's immune system is triggered to either produce antibodies or enhance immunity. If you're exposed to the actual disease in the future, your immune system is ready to fight it. Vaccines can prevent the onset of a disease or reduce its severity.  Immunizations are important because they protect us from serious diseases and prevent their spread. For instance, vaccines have helped prevent outbreaks of diseases like measles, mumps, and whooping cough. Some vaccines require boosters to maintain protection against diseases.  For children, vaccinations are often a prerequisite for school or daycare enrollment. The recommended immunizations for children include Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Pneumococcal, Poliovirus, Influenza, Measles, mumps, rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis A, Meningococcal, and COVID-19.  Vaccines are generally safe, but like any medication, they can have side effects. These are usually minor and disappear in a few days. Serious side effects are extremely rare.  Vaccines are very effective, with most recommended childhood immunizations being 90%-100% effective. However, in rare cases, a child might not become fully immunized against a disease after receiving a vaccine. Even in such cases, if your child is exposed to an infectious disease, the symptoms will usually be milder than if they had not been immunized at all.  There are some misconceptions about vaccines. Some people question the need to vaccinate against rare diseases. But it's important to understand that vaccines keep these diseases rare. Others worry about the preservative thimerosal used in some vaccines, but no harmful effects have been reported. Moreover, since 2001, most vaccines used in the U.S. don't contain thimerosal as a preservative. Lastly, despite concerns, research has shown no connection between vaccines and autism.

Triglycerides, another form of fat that doctors measure during cholesterol testing, can also contribute to the risk of heart disease or stroke, especially when coupled with low levels of HDL cholesterol. High triglyceride levels also increase the risk of diabetes.   The American Heart Association recommends regular cholesterol testing from the age of 20.

The American Heart Association (AHA) and CDC recommend the same frequency for individuals aged 20 or above with low overall heart disease risk, but suggest a risk calculation for heart attack or stroke after age 40 to determine the screening frequency. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommends initial cholesterol testing for children between ages 9 and 11, with a repeat test every 5 years. After 20 years of age, NHLBI recommends tests every 5 years, with biannual checks starting from ages 45(for men) or 55(for women), and annual checks from age 65. However, these guidelines may be adjusted for those with heart disease risk factors such as a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease.

Hormonal birth control is divided into long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and hormonal implants, and short-acting forms like birth control pills, patches, vaginal rings, and shots. LARC methods are highly effective (less than 1 in 100 failure rate) and reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions.  Barrier methods include male and female condoms and spermicides, with effectiveness ranging from 70% to 98%. Non-prescription options like the sponge (68-84% effective) and spermicides (70% effective) are also mentioned. Prescription-only options like the diaphragm, cervical cap, and cervical shield, which are about 90% effective in preventing pregnancy, are also discussed.  IUDs, either hormone-based or copper-based, are noted to be 99% effective and can last from 3 to 10 years. Vaginal contraception methods are also discussed, including a non-hormonal gel called Phexxi, which maintains the vagina's acidic pH to kill sperm and is 90-93% effective.  Emergency contraception is explained as an option after unprotected sex, with the copper-T IUD being the most effective. Several hormonal pills are listed, while it's noted that regular birth control pills can also be used in higher doses for emergency contraception, albeit less effectively and with potential for nausea.  The document also provides tips for ensuring birth control effectiveness, such as checking expiration dates, correct storage, following instructions, using the correct size and lubrication for condoms, and having emergency contraception on hand.

The irregular rhythm impedes the heart's ability to pump effectively, increasing the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other heart complications. Symptoms include heart palpitations, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, and increased frequency of urination. However, not all individuals with AFib experience these symptoms, and their severity can be influenced by factors such as age and the extent to which the condition affects heart function.  Risk factors for developing AFib include older age, high blood pressure, obesity, family history, alcoholism, other heart conditions, previous heart surgery, diabetes, thyroid problems, chronic kidney disease, lung disease, sleep apnea, and drug use. AFib can present as a fleeting sensation or persist for extended periods, and is classified based on the duration of symptoms into paroxysmal fibrillation (symptoms last 7 days or less), persistent AFib (symptoms last more than 7 days), and permanent AFib (symptoms that don't resolve).   AFib can feel like a flutter or quiver in the chest, with the heart beating faster than usual, pounding, or racing. In some instances, the heart may skip a beat. The document advises individuals experiencing AFib symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, especially if their heart doesn't return to a normal rhythm within a few minutes or if symptoms worsen. Critical symptoms that require immediate emergency medical attention include chest pain, pain spreading to the jaw, neck, arms, back, or stomach, nausea, cold sweat, drooping face, arm weakness, and trouble speaking.  The document also mentions that a dangerous heart rate in AFib depends on several factors, including overall health and underlying medical conditions.

Heart Valve Disease: This is when one of your heart's valves doesn't open or close properly, leading to blocked blood flow or leakage. It could be caused by infections like rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, high blood pressure, CAD, or a heart attack.  5. Pericardial Disease: This affects the sac that surrounds your heart, often caused by a viral infection or inflammatory diseases. It can lead to inflammation of the pericardium and often follows open-heart surgery.  6. Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease of the heart muscle, which can get stretched, thickened, or stiff. It may be caused by genetic heart conditions, reactions to drugs or toxins, or viral infections.  7. Congenital Heart Disease: This occurs when the heart doesn't form correctly in a baby still in the womb. The issues can range from holes in the heart wall to a narrow valve decreasing blood flow to the lungs, or a small blood vessel not closing up at birth.

Rate control is not a cure, but it keeps the heart rate in check and improves the quality of life by reducing AFib symptoms and improving hemodynamics. The target heart rate depends upon the seriousness of the condition, with an ideal resting heart rate below 80 beats per minute for symptomatic AFib patients.  Rate control differs from rhythm control as it focuses on the speed of the heartbeats rather than their regularity. Despite a lack of consensus on which approach is superior, rate control drugs tend to be safer and have broader effects on heart disease. They are particularly effective when combined with anticoagulant drugs.  Various rate control drugs are available, including Beta-blockers (atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, sotalol), Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), and Cardiac glycosides (digoxin). The choice of drug depends on factors like the severity of symptoms, heart's pumping efficiency, presence of heart failure, and the cause of AFib. Other comorbid conditions like heart valve disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or pre-excitation are also considered.  Potential side effects of these drugs include fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, rhythm problems, and toxicity (particularly with cardiac glycosides). The usual first choice is beta-blockers, with amiodarone as an alternative if the primary drugs are ineffective or unsuitable. The appropriate dosage is determined through Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG), Ambulatory rhythm monitoring, and Exercise testing.  In case of an acute AFib episode, quick rate control might be achieved using IV medications or electrical cardioversion, especially if there is oxygen deprivation to the heart muscle, low blood pressure, or decompensated heart failure.

A balanced microbiome influences the immune system, aids in the breakdown of toxic food compounds, produces vitamins and amino acids, prevents the overgrowth of harmful bacteria, and assists in digesting complex carbs. Disruption of this balance is associated with diseases like Crohn's disease.   In Crohn's disease, the gut microbiome exhibits less diverse bacterial communities and reduced species that reduce inflammation. While it's unclear whether these changes cause Crohn's or result from its symptoms or treatment, factors like early life antibiotic use, smoking, and stomach flu infections that affect the microbiome are known to increase Crohn's risk.   During Crohn's flare-ups, species like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae thrive, resulting in increased inflammation and out-competing beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are believed to prevent certain diseases.   Diet can significantly influence bacterial balance. Consuming fiber-rich foods can increase SCFA production, creating a gut environment unfavorable to harmful bacteria. However, sudden introduction of such foods can cause discomfort, so it's recommended to introduce them gradually. Probiotic foods and a balanced intake of fats, avoiding trans fats and excessive saturated fats, can also be beneficial.

Breastfeeding reduces the chances of getting pregnant but doesn't eliminate the need for birth control. The choice of birth control should not negatively affect breast milk production. Different forms of birth control require different levels of user interaction. Some methods require daily or weekly management while others require less frequent attention but may need a doctor\u2019s visit.  Condoms are unique as they also provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some types of birth control can even reduce or stop menstrual flow. However, all forms of birth control can potentially have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health conditions or taking specific medications.  The cost of birth control varies significantly, from $2 for a condom to $6000 for sterilization surgery, and insurance coverage can influence these costs. Moreover, certain forms of birth control, like hormone-based pills, can pose health risks if you're over 45. For transgender or nonbinary individuals, finding a suitable method of birth control may require some trial and error. Finally, religious and cultural beliefs can greatly influence the choice of birth control.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a patient."}

Medications can help control symptoms and even push the disease into remission, meaning you won't have any symptoms for a while.  The first treatment goal is usually to reduce inflammation and ease discomfort. Steroids are often used for this purpose. They can be taken by mouth or given as an injection, typically for 3-4 months. It's important to let all healthcare providers know if you're on steroids and to avoid stopping them suddenly without a doctor's approval.  Anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce swelling in the intestine; aminosalicylates are often effective for mild and moderate cases. But these can cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  To help control your body's natural inflammatory response, your doctor might prescribe immunosuppressants. However, these can raise your risk for certain types of cancer and make you more susceptible to infections.  Antibacterial drugs can treat infections in your digestive tract, but long-term use can cause tingling in your hands and feet (neuropathy) or sun sensitivity. Biologics, which are antibodies made in a lab, can calm an overactive immune system and are often used for moderate or severe Crohn's disease.  If other therapies aren't effective, your doctor might combine biologic and immune-suppressing drugs, but this approach has a higher risk of side effects, including infections and cancer.  Over-the-counter medications like anti-diarrheal meds or pain relievers like acetaminophen can help manage symptoms. However, it's best to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen, as they can increase your risk for ulcers and internal bleeding.  Finally, because Crohn's can deplete your body's stores of certain nutrients, you might need supplements for iron, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and folate.

The illness typically lasts for 3 to 7 days.  Treatment includes consultation with a healthcare professional, the use of over-the-counter medications like Pepto-Bismol to reduce symptoms, and most importantly, rehydration. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is recommended for replacing lost fluids and salts. Certain antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, rifamycin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim may shorten the length of illness. However, these medications should be used under medical supervision due to potential complications. In children and infants, the greatest risk is dehydration, which should be treated with ORS.   Prevention primarily involves careful selection of food and drinks in areas with poor sanitation. The safest beverages are boiled water, hot beverages made with boiled water, and factory-sealed beverages. Consuming hot, cooked food and avoiding raw vegetables, fruits, unpasteurized dairy products, raw meat, and certain types of fish can also reduce the risk.   For water purification, boiling is the most reliable method, and if that is not possible, chemical disinfectants like iodine or chlorine can be used. The use of portable water filters is not recommended due to lack of verified results on their effectiveness.   In severe cases marked by bloody diarrhea, inability to keep fluids down, or fever and chills, medical attention should be sought immediately.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on food_and_recipes from the perspective of a doctor."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/high-cholesterol-treatment-always", "category": "heart_disease", "perspective": "patient", "summary": "patient : The document explains about high cholesterol and its implications on heart health. High cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease, and various factors such as age, weight, smoking habits, and family history can further influence this risk.   Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood and having too much of it can cause blood clots, potentially leading to stroke or heart attack. There are two main types of cholesterol: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often referred to as 'bad cholesterol', and High-density lipoprotein (HDL), or 'good cholesterol'. High levels of LDL can cause blockages in your arteries, increasing heart disease risk. On the other hand, having more HDL can help clear out LDL, thereby protecting your heart.  There are different types of high cholesterol based on what's causing it. Primary high cholesterol is usually genetic, while secondary high cholesterol can be linked to health conditions like diabetes, heavy drinking, chronic kidney disease, and lack of exercise.  Treatment for high cholesterol typically starts with lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications might be needed if lifestyle changes aren't enough to lower cholesterol levels. These could include statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements.  It's important to note that everyone with high cholesterol should start with heart-healthy lifestyle changes, but depending on your risk factor, you may also need medications. Your doctor can calculate your risk of a heart attack in the next 10 to 30 years based on various factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, race, sex, smoking habits, and family history.  The document also mentions that if you're unsure about starting medication, your doctor might suggest certain heart disease screening tests like a coronary calcium scan or a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein blood test. These can help assess your risk and guide treatment decisions.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a patient."}

It is usually linked to home-canned fruits and vegetables, but can also be contracted through other means, such as wounds, inhalation, and even from some cosmetic or medical procedures.  The disease is caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which releases a neurotoxin that attacks the nervous system. It can affect both adults and infants, with babies potentially swallowing spores from dust, soil, or honey. People with serious gut health conditions, drug users who inject black tar heroin, or those who have had too much Botox toxin injected are also at risk.  The symptoms of botulism typically start with weakness that begins on both sides of the face and progresses to the neck and the rest of the body. Other early signs include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and shortness of breath. If left untreated, symptoms could progress to paralysis of the arms and legs and the muscles used for breathing.  Diagnosis of botulism usually starts with a physical examination, and lab tests may be ordered to confirm. Treatment involves hospital admission and may include antitoxins, antibiotics, breathing aids, and therapy programs.  Prevention of botulism involves practicing good hygiene and careful food storage, particularly when canning food at home. Boiling home-canned food for 10 minutes can kill the bacteria, and proper refrigeration can prevent its growth.

These signs can provide important health clues and any abnormality could indicate health issues.   Body temperature is generally checked using a digital thermometer. Normal temperature is 98.6 F if taken in the mouth, and 99.6 F if taken in the bottom. If it's more than that, your child may have a fever.   Heart rate, or pulse, tells you how many times the heart beats each minute. Normal heart rate varies with age. For instance, infants have 100-160 beats per minute while adolescents have 60-100 beats per minute.   Respiratory rate is the number of breaths your child takes per minute. Normal rates also vary by age; infants typically have 30-60 breaths per minute while adolescents have 12-16 breaths per minute.   Blood pressure measures the force of blood flowing through the vessels. Children can have high blood pressure or low blood pressure, both of which can be caused by various factors such as heart defects, kidney disease, dehydration, etc. Your child's doctor will likely start to check blood pressure at age 3.

This doesn't mean the heart has stopped working, but rather it's not working at its best. This can cause blood to move slower through your body and increase pressure in your heart. Over time, this can cause the heart to stretch or become stiff, making it difficult for the heart to pump enough oxygen and nutrients to meet the body's needs. This can cause fluid to build up in the body, leading to congestion.   Heart failure can be caused by a variety of conditions that damage the heart muscle, including coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and conditions that overwork the heart like high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, and heart defects present at birth. Symptoms of heart failure can range from none to severe and can include shortness of breath, fatigue, rapid or irregular heartbeats, reduced ability to exercise, swelling, weight gain, nausea, and chest pain.  To diagnose heart failure, your doctor may ask about your symptoms and medical history, conduct a physical exam, and order tests such as blood tests, chest x-rays, and an echocardiogram. Treatment for heart failure can include medications, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and in some cases, surgery. It's also important to monitor your symptoms, maintain a healthy weight, limit salt intake, prevent respiratory infections, and take your medications as prescribed.

Hormonal changes seem to influence eczema's manifestation, especially during periods of stress or natural bodily changes. While a strong genetic link hasn't been established, the condition tends to run in families and typically emerges in infancy or early childhood.  Hormonal changes can impact the skin's moisture barrier, leading to intense itching and potentially triggering an eczema outbreak. Notably, hormonal changes during puberty can affect eczema, with slightly more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls. However, post-puberty, girls are more affected, potentially due to the influence of female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, on immune system cells that affect the skin barrier. Conversely, male sex hormones appear to suppress such reactions, reducing inflammation and other eczema symptoms.  Around 47% of women with eczema have worsening symptoms during premenstrual phase due to the sudden drop in estrogen levels. High estrogen levels during pregnancy can shift immune system's focus away from protective cells towards those guarding the fetus, possibly triggering eczema flare-ups. Hormonal fluctuations during menopause could also potentially lead to eczema relapses.   Stress hormones like cortisol, which suppresses the immune system, might also contribute to eczema flare-ups. Moreover, a strong link exists between eczema and mental health, with over 30% of people with eczema diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety.

This condition is known as hyperthyroidism and it can lead to AFib, where your heart pumps less blood than normal, increasing the risk of stroke.   If you have hyperthyroidism, you are more likely to develop AFib, especially as you age. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, sleep problems, shakiness, neck swelling, muscle weakness, and unexplained weight loss. AFib symptoms, on the other hand, include irregular heartbeat, chest pain, confusion, dizziness, weakness, difficulty exercising, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating.  If you experience any symptoms of AFib or hyperthyroidism, consult your doctor. Tests for these conditions may involve blood tests, imaging, Electrocardiogram (EKG), Echocardiogram, stress test, and chest X-ray.   To manage these conditions, doctors aim to normalize thyroid hormone levels and control heart rate. Medications like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin may be used to control heart rate. To prevent blood clots, anticoagulants like warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban may be used. For thyroid treatment, anti-thyroid drugs are used initially, followed by thyroid ablation, a treatment that involves destroying the thyroid with radioactive iodine. After this treatment, daily thyroid replacement hormone is necessary. ", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a normal person."}

Smoking cigarettes is the cause of 3 out of 10 cancer deaths in the U.S., with 80% of lung cancer deaths tied to tobacco use. Smoking is linked to 12 different types of cancers, including lung, throat, stomach, bladder, and leukemia. The danger comes from the over 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are known to cause cancer. Exposure to secondhand smoke can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 30%. Smoking not only damages your DNA, leading to abnormal cell growth, but also weakens your body's immune response, making it harder to fight off cancer. Importantly, there's no safe way to use tobacco and even brief exposure can raise your cancer risk. However, quitting smoking can significantly reduce your cancer risk. The more you reduce your smoking and the sooner you quit, the lower your chance of developing any of the 12 cancers tied to smoking. After 5 years of quitting, your risk for several types of cancer drops by half, and after 20 years, the risk of certain cancers falls to the same level as a non-smoker.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a normal person."}

Crohn's disease remission refers to the condition's inactive phase, characterized by the cessation of inflammation and painful damage to the bowel and colon, with the patient displaying no symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, or fatigue. It is not a cure, with most patients experiencing cycles of remission and relapses. The document outlines five types of remission: clinical, deep healing, histologic, surgical, and biochemical, each defined by different factors such as absence of symptoms, healing of lesions, normal cell appearance, post-surgery disease inactivity, and absence of inflammation markers respectively.   Treatment is pivotal in achieving and maintaining remission, with medication being the primary method. These include steroids, aminosalicylates, immune system slowing drugs, TNF inhibitors, newer biologics, and antibiotics. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary, involving resection of damaged parts of the intestines.   Remission is determined through the Crohn's disease activity index, scopes and scans, or blood tests. However, remission duration varies, with chances of relapse increasing over time. To maintain remission, patients are advised to adhere to their treatment plans, avoid trigger foods and drinks, add healthy foods to their diet, quit smoking, avoid NSAIDs and unnecessary antibiotics, and keep regular doctor's appointments.   Relapses can occur, often more common in women and those diagnosed before 25.

The primary objective is to detect and eliminate harmful tumors. Surgical oncologists collaborate with primary care doctors to formulate treatment plans, which often involve removing tumors and nearby cancerous tissues, and conducting biopsies to determine the presence and severity of cancer.   Surgical oncology is beneficial in early and advanced stages of cancer. It can be used preventively, specifically for individuals with high cancer risk due to factors like strong family history of cancer or gene mutations. It also aids in diagnosis when there's a suspected tumor, wherein tissue is extracted and examined for cancer cells. Moreover, it helps in assessing the severity of cancer by determining tumor size and the extent of its spread.   Various surgical procedures are employed to treat cancer. Curative surgery is performed when a tumor is localized and can be entirely removed. Debulking surgery is used when complete tumor removal is risky; in such cases, a portion of the tumor is removed and the remainder treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Supportive surgery is done to enhance the effectiveness of other cancer treatments, while palliative surgery is used to alleviate symptoms in advanced cancer cases.  Post-surgery, reconstructive surgery might be necessary to restore appearance and function of areas affected by tumor removal. Surgical oncology is applicable for various cancer types, including but not limited to, breast, esophagus, throat, thyroid, skin, lung, gallbladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, spine, uterus, bone, and colon cancer.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a doctor."}

In AFib, blood can pool and clot in the heart's upper chambers, potentially obstructing blood flow to the brain and raising stroke risk. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are often prescribed to prevent clots, but these can increase the risk of severe bleeding in the stomach, brain, and bladder.   To assess a patient's bleeding risk, doctors utilize the HAS-BLED scoring system, where each letter represents a risk factor: Hypertension, Abnormal kidney and liver function, Stroke history, Bleeding tendency, Labile international normalized ratios, Elderly age, and Drugs and alcohol use. Most risk factors contribute one point to the total score, but certain factors like kidney and liver function issues, specific medications, or alcohol intake can add two points.  The HAS-BLED score guides doctors in managing patient care, ensuring individualized treatment for AFib patients.

Some patients with Crohn's may also present with respiratory diseases including asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, possibly due to an underlying autoimmune response and inflammation in the airways.   Although most patients with Crohn's do not develop colon cancer, chronic intestinal inflammation can elevate the risk, necessitating frequent screening colonoscopies every 1-2 years. The disease may also contribute to psychological conditions like depression and anxiety, possibly exacerbated by the chronic nature of Crohn's and the lifestyle changes it necessitates.   Patients with Crohn's, along with other inflammatory bowel disease conditions like ulcerative colitis, have an elevated risk for heart disease, potentially linked to systemic inflammation affecting the heart and blood vessels. Inflammatory bowel disease could be considered a heart attack risk factor.   Osteoporosis could be a concern for patients with severe Crohn's, particularly those on steroid medication, due to impaired absorption of calcium and vitamin D.

The primary evidence comes from the Physicians Health Study, which followed approximately 4,500 healthy men over a decade. The study found that men with high total cholesterol and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol, more frequently had kidneys that were not functioning optimally. Men with poorly functioning kidneys also had lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good cholesterol. Another study involving over 15,000 individuals over 3 years found that low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides were linked to an increased risk of kidney disease.   People with high cholesterol are nearly twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease. Kidney disease also alters the body's handling of cholesterol and other lipids, making kidney disease and high cholesterol often coexist.   Medications, particularly statins, can help reduce cholesterol levels and thus lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes in individuals with early-stage kidney disease. However, the benefit of statins in advanced kidney disease, especially in those requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant, remains unclear.

It spreads easily through food and drink and can impact your health significantly. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and stomach cramps, and could also include low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle ache, and fatigue. These symptoms usually appear within 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus.  If you get infected, you might continue to shed the virus for 2 weeks or more, potentially infecting others. You can return to work or school after being symptom-free for 48 hours, but if you work in food service, it's encouraged to wait for 72 hours.  Norovirus spreads when you eat or drink contaminated foods and beverages or touch contaminated surfaces. It can also spread from person to person through shared food or utensils, handshakes, or other close contact. It can even spread through the air when someone with the virus vomits.   If you have norovirus symptoms, your doctor may confirm that you have the illness through a stool test. However, diagnosis is usually based on symptoms.

If your eyes start feeling irritated or inflamed, it is advised to see an eye doctor called an ophthalmologist right away. There are a few eye conditions associated with UC, including Episcleritis, Scleritis, Uveitis, and Keratopathy.   Episcleritis is an inflammation of the white of the eye and is often linked to the severity of UC. It can be treated with eye drops and other medications. Scleritis, which also affects the white part of the eye, can cause pain, redness, and blurry vision, among other symptoms. It requires immediate treatment to avoid potential vision loss.  Uveitis is a serious condition that involves inflammation of the middle layer of the eye wall and can lead to permanent eye damage and vision loss if not treated promptly. Keratopathy, a rarer condition, involves issues with the cornea and can cause dry eyes.  The document also mentions that some eye complications may be caused by UC medications. For example, steroids can lead to cataracts and glaucoma. Retinopathies, diseases that damage the light-sensing part of the eye, can occur due to certain biologic drugs used to treat UC.  The document emphasizes the importance of regular eye exams, especially for those with UC, as early detection can help avoid serious eye complications.

It's not meant to be a regular form of birth control, but rather a backup option for emergencies like condom breakage or missed birth control pills. There are several types of emergency contraception, including pills like Plan B One-Step and Ella, as well as the copper IUD. These work mainly by delaying or stopping ovulation, preventing fertilization.  Certain factors such as your age, when you had sex, and your weight can affect which type of emergency contraception is best for you. For example, Plan B starts to lose its effectiveness in women over 165 pounds. Emergency contraception works best if taken as soon as possible after sex, and its effectiveness decreases over time.  There are some potential side effects, though most people don't experience any. These can include nausea, mild stomach pain, headache, or changes in menstrual cycle. If you're already pregnant, emergency contraception won't work and shouldn't be taken. Taking more than one type of emergency contraception won't increase effectiveness and could even interfere with each other. Emergency contraceptives don't protect against sexually transmitted diseases, so it's important to use protection like condoms.  Emergency contraception can be found at places like drugstores, health centers, and some doctor's offices. Costs can vary, but insurance may cover some types.

It's common in both children and adults, and often comes and goes with time. Symptoms usually start before the age of 5 and include red, scaly areas on the skin, itching, and sometimes blisters or cracked, bleeding skin.  The exact cause of atopic dermatitis is unknown, but it tends to run in families and is often linked with allergies, hay fever, and asthma. It can be triggered by things like strong soaps, certain fabrics, perfumes, tobacco smoke, stress, dry air, long hot showers, sweating, skin infections, dust, sand, and certain foods. However, it's important to note that it's not contagious.  Diagnosis usually involves a physical exam and possibly a skin patch allergy test. While there's no cure for atopic dermatitis, treatments aim to control symptoms and include steroid creams or pills, antihistamines, antibiotics, and certain immune-suppressing drugs. Light therapy and wet dressings can also help. At home, warm oatmeal baths, using a humidifier, and wearing loose clothing can provide relief.  People with atopic dermatitis are also more likely to develop complications like asthma, skin infections, and sleep issues.

Birth control pills are hormonal contraceptives that prevent pregnancy primarily by inhibiting ovulation and modifying the cervical mucus and uterine lining. When taken correctly, they offer up to 99.9% effectiveness, but do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.  The three types of birth control pills are combination pills (containing estrogen and progestin), progestin-only pills, and extended/continuous use pills. The document lists a variety of brands that contain different combinations of hormones such as ethinylestradiol, norethindrone, norgestimate, drospirenone, and levomefolate.   The effectiveness of these contraceptives depends on correct and consistent use, which involves taking one pill per day at the same time. Missing pills increases the risk of pregnancy and may require a backup method of contraception.   The side effects of birth control pills are usually not severe, but some less common but serious side effects include abdominal pain, chest pain, headaches, eye problems, and swelling or aching in the legs and thighs. These could be signs of serious disorders like liver disease, gallbladder disease, stroke, blood clots, high blood pressure, or heart disease.  Certain drugs, including antibiotics, antiseizure meds, and some herbal supplements, can impact the efficacy of birth control pills. Alcohol does not directly affect the pill's effectiveness but can influence decision-making regarding sexual activity and slow the rate at which alcohol leaves the body.   The document also discusses cost considerations, packaging styles, and legal aspects surrounding the use of birth control pills.

They work by creating a barrier that keeps semen and other body fluids from entering the vagina, rectum, or mouth.   When used correctly, male condoms are about 98% effective at preventing pregnancy, while female condoms are about 95% effective. However, the effectiveness decreases if not used properly. They also lower the chances of passing STDs.   There are many types of male and female condoms available. Male condoms can be made from latex, plastic, or lambskin, and can have different features like lubrication, spermicide coating, or textures for extra pleasure. Female condoms are typically made from nitrile, a latex-free material, and come pre-lubricated.  To use a male condom, it should be placed on a fully erect penis and unrolled all the way down. After sex, it should be carefully removed to prevent spillage of semen. Female condoms are inserted into the vagina before sex and removed afterwards.  The cost of condoms varies, with male condoms costing up to $1 each and female condoms around $2 each. They can be purchased from local drug stores, supermarkets, or received for free from certain health centers or clinics.  Proper usage of condoms involves checking the expiration date, ensuring the condom is not torn or damaged, and using a new one for each act of sex.

Symptoms include sharp cramps in the stomach, an urge to use the bathroom frequently, belly pain, fever, and watery or bloody diarrhea. It usually goes away in 5 to 7 days with rest and fluids, but severe cases may require hospitalization.  The bacteria spread when feces from an infected person find their way into another person's mouth. This can happen through touching contaminated objects, eating tainted food, swallowing infected water, or sexual contact.  If mild, symptoms usually clear up within a week without treatment. However, it can be severe in seniors, infants, or people with weakened immune systems. Seek medical help if your diarrhea is severe, especially if blood or mucus is present, if you have a fever, or signs of dehydration like dry mouth or lightheadedness.  Shigellosis can lead to complications like dehydration, joint pain, infections in the bloodstream, destruction of red blood cells, and seizures (more common in young children). A lab test of a stool sample is often needed to diagnose this disease.  While there is no vaccine or cure, good hygiene is crucial in prevention.

The disease can fluctuate between periods of remission and relapses where symptoms are active again.   There are different categories of remission, including clinical remission (no symptoms), deep healing (no signs of disease when checked by a doctor), and surgical remission (no disease activity after surgery).   Treatment is usually required to send Crohn's into remission, and it typically involves medications to ease inflammation and reduce symptoms. In some cases, surgery might be required to remove damaged parts of the intestines.   To maintain remission, it's important to follow the treatment plan, avoid trigger foods, and consume a healthy diet. It's also advised not to smoke, avoid certain medications that can cause gut issues, and keep up with doctor's appointments.

Their effects can last from four months to more than a year, depending on the type of fillers used. Wrinkles are primarily caused by the weakening of the skin's structural components: collagen, hyaluronic acid, and elastin. Fillers help restore this structure, firming the skin and reducing wrinkles.   There are several types of fillers, including hyaluronic acid fillers, synthetic fillers, collagen fillers, and autologous fillers. Hyaluronic acid fillers are the most popular and have few side effects, though they may cause redness, swelling, and bruising at the injection site. Synthetic fillers offer longer-lasting effects but are more likely to cause side effects, such as nodules or bumps under the skin. Collagen fillers provide natural-looking results but don't last as long as other fillers and carry a risk of allergic reactions. Autologous fillers use fat or blood from the patient's body to fill wrinkles, minimizing allergic reactions but requiring more complex procedures.  Despite being among the safest cosmetic procedures, wrinkle fillers can still cause side effects. Therefore, treatments should only be performed by board-certified dermatologists or plastic surgeons. It's also crucial to use FDA-approved fillers, and procedures should be done in a sterile, medical setting.

Immunizations have successfully prevented epidemics of common infectious diseases like measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio, and smallpox.  Further, immunizations are crucial for children and are often prerequisites for school or daycare enrollment. Some of these required immunizations include Hepatitis B, Rotavirus, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus Influenzae type B, Pneumococcal, Poliovirus, Influenza, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis A, Meningococcal, and COVID-19. If a child misses a vaccine, they can \"catch up\" at a later date.

While dietary cholesterol doesn't directly raise the risk of heart disease, foods with cholesterol often also contain high levels of saturated fats (like red meat and full-fat dairy products). Too much saturated fat can increase your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol can accumulate in your arteries, leading to heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes.  Eggs, although high in cholesterol, are low in saturated fat. Current research is mixed regarding the link between eggs and heart disease, especially for people with type 2 diabetes or heart failure. The document advises that it is generally safe for healthy people to eat one egg a day.   Everyone should strive to follow a heart-healthy diet, low in dietary cholesterol and saturated fats. However, genetics play a significant role in your cholesterol levels, meaning dietary cholesterol doesn't always affect your blood cholesterol levels. Some people, however, may be more sensitive to dietary cholesterol.   Your doctor may recommend limiting foods with dietary cholesterol if you have certain health risks, such as high LDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, a family history of high cholesterol or early heart disease, or if you smoke.

These contraceptives introduce synthetic versions of estrogen and progestin into the body to prevent pregnancy. These hormones can lead to fluid retention, potentially causing breasts to feel or appear larger.   This change is usually temporary and subsides after a few months. Additionally, birth control can amplify breast tenderness or pain, a normal symptom around menstrual periods. The pain usually peaks right before the period and can extend to the armpit or upper arm.  The document also outlines other potential side effects from hormonal birth control, such as headaches, breast tingling, irregular periods, mood changes, lower sex drive, acne, and nausea. These effects are typically non-serious and disappear as the body adjusts to the new hormonal levels. Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen can alleviate some of these symptoms.  The document emphasizes the importance of discussing with a healthcare professional before starting hormonal birth control. If patients wish to avoid breast changes or prefer contraceptives with fewer hormones, they should communicate this to their doctor. The document also lists several symptoms, including abdominal pain, chest aches, eye issues, seizures, severe mood swings, depression, breast lumps, and fainting, which are not typical effects of hormonal birth control and could indicate another health problem.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a doctor."}

After cancer treatment, you might notice you're not as often in the mood for sex and may experience physical changes like hair loss or weight fluctuation. You may also have trouble controlling your bladder or bowels. Some of these effects may disappear quickly, while others could last for months or even years.   For example, men who have been treated for prostate cancer might find it harder to get or keep an erection. Women who had radiation or hormone therapy may experience severe vaginal dryness that can make sex painful. However, it's important to know that these changes don't mean you have to stop being intimate. There are ways to explore and maintain closeness with your partner, such as holding hands, kissing, cuddling, or giving each other massages.   You can also discuss with your doctor about potential treatments. For men, medications like sildenafil and tadalafil can improve blood flow to the penis, making it easier to get and keep an erection. Women with severe vaginal dryness can consider using low-dose estrogen as a pill, cream, or ring that fits inside the vagina. If these medications don't work, medical devices like a vacuum erection device for men or a vaginal dilator for women can help.  It's important to communicate openly with your partner about your feelings and any changes to your body. If you've had a body part removed during cancer treatment, be honest with your partner about how you'd like this area to be treated during intimacy.

Female condoms, also known as internal condoms, are barrier contraceptives that prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). They are thin tubes made of nitrile rubber or lab-made latex inserted into the vagina before intercourse, blocking sperm from reaching the uterus and preventing contact with sexual fluids.  The document details the proper use of female condoms, including precautions such as ensuring the package is not damaged, the condom has not expired, and consistent use throughout intercourse. It also emphasizes that double condom use (male and female) can lead to condom breakage.  When used correctly, female condoms are about 95% effective, slightly less effective than male condoms. Incorrect use increases the pregnancy rate significantly. While they do not eliminate the risk of STDs, they significantly reduce the chances.  Advantages of female condoms include non-requirement of a prescription, the ability to insert them in advance, suitability for various penis sizes, and compatibility with any lubricant. They also provide extra stimulation and are an effective option for those allergic to latex.   However, there are disadvantages such as a higher failure rate compared to male condoms, difficulty in finding them in stores, higher cost, and potential noise during sex. There are also potential allergic reactions to the material, discomfort during use, and a potential risk of urinary tract infections if the condom stays in for too long.  Female condoms are available with a prescription and should be covered by insurance, including Medicaid. They can be obtained from health clinics, some nonprofits, and online.

Food allergies, particularly to peanuts, milk, wheat, soy, and eggs, can occur in kids with this type of eczema. Symptoms include itchiness, swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, and a drop in blood pressure.   Asthma and allergic rhinitis usually come after eczema and food allergies. Asthma can make it hard to breathe, and allergic rhinitis, triggered by substances like pollen and dust, can cause symptoms like a runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.   Another related condition is allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed skin irritation that occurs when the skin comes into contact with certain substances. Eczema might weaken the skin's defenses and make it more susceptible to these substances.   Additionally, there's a connection between eczema and mental health issues like depression and anxiety.

This condition is managed with medication or surgery, but there's no definitive cure and flare-ups can occur post-treatment.  Probiotics, live microorganisms that promote good bacteria growth in the intestines, are often considered for UC treatment. They function as a barrier, preventing harmful bacteria from reaching the intestinal wall and balancing the gut microbiota, thus reducing inflammation. E. coli Nissle, a non-pathogenic strain, and VSL#3, a mix of eight probiotics, have been shown to induce remission in some UC patients.  However, not all probiotics show equal effectiveness in treating UC, and existing studies have been small-scale. Before starting a probiotic regimen, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised.  When taking probiotics for UC, it's important to note that they should be taken over a prolonged period due to stomach acid's bacteria-killing properties. To maintain benefits, the intake of probiotics needs to be continuous; ceasing could trigger a flare-up.  Prebiotics, which nourish good bacteria, could also be beneficial for UC. These are derived from indigestible food fibers and help gut cells build protective layers against harmful bacteria. However, they may exacerbate symptoms in individuals with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and FODMAPs intolerance.  Probiotics have been shown to alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, but their effectiveness in Crohn's disease is unclear.

Surgical oncology can be useful in various stages of cancer - it can be used as a preventative measure in high-risk patients by removing tissue that's likely to become cancerous. It can also be used to confirm if you have cancer through a procedure called biopsy where a growth is removed and examined for cancer cells.   Moreover, surgical oncology can be used to determine the severity of the cancer by looking at the size of the tumor and seeing if it has spread. It can also be used to treat cancer by removing tumors and cancerous tissue. In some cases, if removing the whole tumor is too dangerous, doctors can remove part of it and treat the rest with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  Even when surgery can't eliminate the cancer, it can be used to alleviate symptoms, like pain caused by a tumor pressing on a nerve or bone. After removing tumors, surgical oncologists can also perform reconstructive surgery to restore the appearance and function of body areas affected by cancer.

Radiation oncologists work in conjunction with other healthcare professionals to devise the best possible treatment plans for cancer patients. They utilize software to precisely map out the radiation delivery areas in patients.  The document outlines two primary types of radiation therapy - external beam and internal. External beam radiation therapy is the more prevalent method, frequently used for treating cancers of the head, breast, lung, colon, and prostate. It involves targeting the cancer site with a radiation source from outside the body. Meanwhile, internal radiation therapy involves placing a solid or liquid radiation source inside the patient's body; this can be done via brachytherapy (implanting the source near the cancer) or systemic radiation (ingesting the source orally or through a vein).  The document also provides an overview of the education and training required to become a radiation oncologist, which includes obtaining a bachelor's degree (preferably in a science-related field), passing the Medical College Admissions Test, attending medical school, completing a residency, possibly fulfilling a fellowship to specialize, and obtaining the appropriate license and certification for practice.  Radiation oncologists treat a wide range of cancers, including liver, lung, lymphoma, brain, breast, bone, pancreatic, colon, paranasal sinus, prostate cancers, sarcomas, head and neck cancers, and leukemia. They also treat non-cancerous conditions such as arteriovenous malformations, acoustic neuroma, brain tumors, spinal cord tumors, and trigeminal neuralgia.  Typically, the first visit to a radiation oncologist entails a review of medical records and x-rays, followed by a physical exam. The oncologist then discusses their findings and proposes a treatment plan. Generally, patients receive radiation treatments five days a week for six to seven weeks. Each session lasts 10-30 minutes, with radiation being administered for only 1-2 minutes. Regular breaks from treatment are given to allow normal cells to recover.

The polio vaccine used to be administered orally and contained a live virus. This method was highly effective but on rare occasions, caused polio. Since 2000, the U.S. has used an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which uses an inactive virus and is given as a shot in the arm or leg.  Children should receive four doses of IPV at various stages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and a booster dose at 4-6 years. Adults usually don't require it, but those at higher risk, such as travelers to areas where polio is common, lab workers handling certain specimens, and healthcare workers in close contact with potential polio patients should consider getting vaccinated.   The vaccine should not be administered to people who have had severe allergic reactions to a previous dose of the polio vaccine or certain antibiotics.

So, quitting smoking is highly recommended. While the exact link between smoking and Crohn's disease is not understood fully, smoking can damage cells in your body, weaken your immune system, slow down healing, and even cause permanent changes to genes in your colon, all of which can aggravate Crohn's disease.  E-cigarettes or vaping, although marketed as a safer alternative to tobacco, also come with health risks. While current studies haven't shown a negative effect on Crohn's disease from vaping, it's safer not to start due to other potential health effects.  For those with Crohn's disease who smoke, the severity of the disease and chances of relapse can be higher. Smoking also might make treatments less effective, increasing the likelihood of needing medications or surgeries. However, quitting smoking can significantly improve Crohn's symptoms and the overall health.  Quitting isn't easy due to the addictive nature of nicotine, but there are ways to help, such as counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medications.

This is a long-term illness and managing it can be expensive. Studies found that people with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like UC generally pay three times more for treatment and two times more in out-of-pocket costs than those without the disease.   Most of these expenses are related to treatment, related illnesses, and emergency room visits. The cost of care can be significantly higher for children, older adults, and certain racial groups.   Your treatment can involve doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which depends on factors like your insurance status, severity of your condition, and the type of service you get. For example, without insurance, a doctor's visit can range from $130 to $180, while an emergency room visit could be $580 to $700.   Your treatment might include blood tests, stool studies, colonoscopies, CT scans, and in severe cases, surgery. After surgery, you might need to wear a bag to collect stool, which would add to your long-term medical costs.  Medications to control symptoms and inflammation are another part of your treatment, and these can range from $2,500 to $25,000 a year without insurance.  Having UC can also impact your work, as you might need time off for appointments or to recover from symptom flare-ups. This can result in a loss of wages.  The stress of managing UC can also impact your mental health, and individuals with UC have higher rates of depression and anxiety.

Fertility awareness methods are central to natural birth control, relying on tracking menstrual cycles to predict fertility. When used correctly, these methods can reduce the chance of pregnancy to less than 5%. However, they require commitment from both partners, and irregular cycles can increase the odds of pregnancy to as high as 24%.   Examples of fertility awareness methods include the rhythm method, the standard-days method, checking cervical mucus, and tracking basal body temperature. The rhythm method involves tracking menstrual cycles for 6-12 months to predict fertility, while the standard-days method simplifies this approach by setting the same days as fertile for everyone. Both methods require regular menstrual cycles to be effective.   The cervical mucus method involves monitoring cervical mucus throughout the cycle to identify ovulation. Basal body temperature can also indicate ovulation, although it can be affected by factors such as illness, stress, alcohol consumption, and changes in sleep environment.   Non-fertility awareness methods include the withdrawal method, which depends on the male partner withdrawing before ejaculation, and exclusive breastfeeding, which can prevent ovulation and is 98% effective in the first 6 months post-partum if guidelines are strictly followed.   Herbal birth control methods are mentioned, although they lack FDA approval and rigorous scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. The document also warns against various ineffective and potentially harmful home remedies.

Initially, lifestyle changes like reducing saturated fats, sugar, and increasing physical activity are recommended. If these changes don't yield enough results, your doctor may prescribe certain medications.  1. Statins: These are often the first choice of drugs prescribed to lower \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) and triglycerides. They can also mildly increase \"good\" cholesterol. However, side effects can include intestinal problems, liver damage, muscle inflammation, and in rare cases, high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes. Memory loss and confusion have been reported, and the FDA is investigating these claims.  2. Bile acid resin drugs: These work inside your intestines, reducing the body's cholesterol supply. Side effects can include constipation, gas, and upset stomach.  3. Ezetimibe: This drug lowers bad cholesterol by blocking its absorption in your small intestine. It can help reduce the risk of heart events when combined with a statin. Common side effects include muscle or back pain, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  4. PCSK9 Inhibitors: These drugs are used when cholesterol can't be managed through lifestyle and statin treatments. They're used primarily in adults with a genetic condition that makes it hard to lower cholesterol or for people with heart disease.  5.

It is caused by disorganized signals in the heart that make the upper heart chambers contract very fast and out of sync. This can be due to damage to the heart's electrical system often resulting from other heart conditions. Sometimes, the cause of atrial fibrillation is unknown.  Several factors can increase your risk for AFib, including age, genetics, heart disease, lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema, an overactive thyroid gland, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, and viral infections.  Here's how some risk factors lead to AFib:  - Age: Your chances of getting AFib increase as you age, especially after 60. - Genes: AFib can run in families, so if a close family member has it, your risk is higher. - Heart disease: Conditions like coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, heart failure, and others can raise your chances of AFib. - Lung disease: Conditions like COPD, emphysema, or a blood clot in your lung can contribute to the development of AFib. - High blood pressure: This is the most common condition linked to AFib, as it can make the upper chambers of your heart work harder.  Certain factors can trigger AFib symptoms, including stimulants like caffeine and cigarettes, alcohol, stress, intense exercise, and poor sleep.   While you can't control all AFib risk factors like age and genetics, a healthy lifestyle can help protect you.

Annually, about 500,000 vasectomies are performed, with the no-scalpel vasectomy being the preferred method due to its less invasive nature and shorter recovery time.   The surgical procedure involves blocking the vas deferens, the tube carrying sperm out of the testicles. Post-vasectomy, the male can still ejaculate, but the fluid doesn't contain sperm, eliminating the risk of pregnancy. Despite this interruption, sperm production continues in the testicles, and there's no external change in the penis and scrotum.   Two types of vasectomy procedures exist: traditional and no-scalpel. Both are outpatient procedures, often performed in a doctor's office, and usually take about 30 minutes. In traditional vasectomy, small incisions are made in the scrotum to access and cut the vas deferens, and the incisions are closed with stitches. Conversely, a no-scalpel vasectomy involves a small puncture in the scrotum, minimizing recovery time and post-operative complications. However, both types of vasectomy do not provide immediate birth control; it takes several months to clear the residual sperm.   A follow-up appointment is typically scheduled 90 days post-procedure to confirm the absence of live sperm. Despite being a highly reliable form of birth control, fewer than 1% of vasectomies fail.

There are two main types: LDL cholesterol, which can clog arteries, and HDL cholesterol, which helps clean out your arteries.   Several factors can affect your cholesterol levels. Unhealthy diet, particularly foods high in saturated fats such as red meat, whole milk, butter, shellfish and eggs, can increase LDL cholesterol. Trans fat is particularly harmful, raising LDL and lowering HDL cholesterol levels.   Being overweight can also contribute to high cholesterol as excess weight affects the way your body makes and removes cholesterol. Lack of exercise not only leads to weight gain but also affects cholesterol levels, although aerobic exercise can boost HDL cholesterol levels.   Smoking can damage blood vessel walls and lower HDL cholesterol levels, while chronic diseases can cause inflammation that can lower your HDL and raise your LDL cholesterol. Pregnancy can temporarily raise cholesterol levels, but they usually drop back after childbirth.   Stress and Type 2 Diabetes can negatively impact your cholesterol levels as well. Genetic factors can also play a role, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition that runs in families making it harder for your body to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood. Lastly, as you age, it becomes harder for your body to remove cholesterol from your blood, which can raise your risk for heart disease.

High cholesterol can lead to artery blockage, blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes. While medication can help, lifestyle changes are necessary to control your cholesterol.  Diet is crucial. To lower your cholesterol, switch to a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. These foods are not only low in cholesterol but also high in fiber, which can improve your cholesterol levels and lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Also, consider adding fish, nuts, low-fat dairy, and lean poultry to your diet.  Avoid foods with a lot of saturated fat like meat, full-fat dairy products, candy, fried foods, and many processed foods. These can increase your total cholesterol levels and may raise your risk for heart disease. Less than 10% of your daily calories should come from saturated fats.  Trans fats, found in hydrogenated fats, are harmful too. They raise blood cholesterol levels and increase heart disease risk more than saturated fats.   However, not all fats and cholesterol are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in fish and nuts reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL). But, some of these foods also lower HDL levels. Olive oil is an exception; it lowers total cholesterol and LDL without affecting HDL levels.  If overweight, eating a balanced diet with reasonable portion sizes can help you lose weight and lower LDL cholesterol.  Exercise can complement your low-cholesterol diet. Regular physical activity may not directly affect LDL levels, but it raises HDL, lowers blood fats (triglycerides), helps maintain a healthy weight, and lowers blood pressure. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise almost daily.  If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases cholesterol buildup in your arteries. If you need help to quit, consult your doctor about medicines or counseling.

It's not the same as a new cancer and can happen anywhere in the body. It's considered a recurrence if the cancer returns after a year of no signs of the disease. Cancer might come back because not all cancer cells were destroyed during the initial treatment. Recurrent cancer can return in the original place, near the original place, or in a completely different part of the body. Doctors use tests like scans and biopsies to determine if cancer has recurred. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others, based on their growth rate, advancement, and the original treatment received. For instance, ovarian and colorectal cancers have relatively high recurrence rates. Treatments for recurrent cancer are dependent on the type and stage of cancer, and where it's located. They can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or biological therapy. It's also mentioned that many people live for extended periods with recurrent cancer, treating it more like a chronic illness.

It's important to limit distractions in this area and check in on your child periodically. Remember to give positive reinforcement when they successfully use the corner to calm themselves.  The calm-down corner has several benefits. It teaches children to recognize and control their emotions, and it's a safe space where they can process their feelings without judgment. It also helps them learn about communication and relationships.   There should be some rules for using the calm-down corner like not letting one child dominate the space, avoiding stimulating electronics, and preventing misuse of the corner to avoid chores or classwork.   Setting up a calm-down corner is quite simple.

Despite its name, it doesn't cause the flu. Hib disease was once the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children, which is an infection of the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord.   Hib can also cause pneumonia, throat infections, blood, bone, and joint infections. The bacteria spread from person to person through sneezing or coughing. Children under age 5 and adults over 65, along with people with compromised immune systems, are most at risk.   Symptoms of Hib depend on the disease it causes and can include fever, pain, breathing difficulties, and more severe symptoms in cases of meningitis. Doctors diagnose Hib through different lab tests and treat it with antibiotics and sometimes hospitalization for serious cases.  Fortunately, there's a Hib vaccine that provides protection against the disease. It's safe, with minor side effects, and is usually given as part of a child's regular vaccination routine. The vaccine is recommended for children under age 5, with the first dose ideally given at age 2 months. Older children and adults may need the vaccine if they're at increased risk for Hib infection.   If a child misses a dose of the vaccine, they should get a catch-up shot at the next doctor's visit. While the vaccine protects against Hib meningitis, it's still possible to develop meningitis from other germs.

Around 30% of children with AD might have a food allergy, which could potentially worsen their eczema symptoms. However, this isn't the case for everyone. If eczema symptoms are hard to manage, it might be helpful to consult a doctor for advice about potential food allergies.  A test called the Allergen-Specific IgE Test can help identify potential food allergies. The test involves mixing your blood with an allergen to see how your immune system reacts. The results may take up to two weeks and can suggest the likelihood of an allergy, but cannot confirm it. Foods commonly linked to atopic dermatitis include cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, soy, tree nuts, wheat, fish, shellfish, and sesame.   The IgE test can be beneficial for children under 5 who react quickly to certain foods or whose AD symptoms don't improve with treatment. It can also be useful if your current treatment isn't effectively managing your symptoms or if other tests aren't suitable.   Symptoms of a food allergy can include hives, itching, swelling, sneezing, coughing, throwing up, and low blood pressure. If you notice these symptoms after eating certain foods, it might be helpful to tell your doctor. Severe allergic reactions, also known as anaphylaxis, can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.  Other tests for food allergies include skin prick tests, oral food challenges, elimination diets, and atopy patch tests. It's important to note that food allergies are distinct from food intolerances (difficulty digesting certain foods) and sensitivities (uncomfortable symptoms without an allergy or intolerance).   Once your doctor helps identify potential food allergies, it's usually best to avoid those foods. However, some children might outgrow food allergies, and food sensitivities might decrease when AD symptoms are under control. Before making any significant changes to your diet, consider speaking with a nutritionist or another health professional. While diet changes might improve AD symptoms, it's generally best to maintain a varied diet.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on eczema from the perspective of a patient."}

Also, having lower levels of good cholesterol or HDL can increase the risk for kidney disease.   If you have high cholesterol, you're twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease. Moreover, having kidney disease increases your risk for heart problems. Therefore, managing high cholesterol and kidney disease is crucial. One way to do this is through medication like statins, which are often prescribed for those with early kidney disease. These drugs help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart problems or stroke. However, it's unclear if these drugs are beneficial for advanced kidney disease or for those on dialysis or who have had a kidney transplant.   Another way to manage your cholesterol with kidney disease is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Skin disorders or allergic skin reactions, excessive exposure to skin-damaging environmental factors, and genetic factors may cause sensitive skin reactions. Patch testing is used to identify allergies contributing to sensitive skin.   Skin-friendly products for sensitive skin contain only a few ingredients and little or no fragrance, while products with antibacterial ingredients, alcohol, retinoids, or alpha-hydroxy acids should be avoided. For cosmetics, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends using products with minimal risk of skin irritation and avoiding waterproof cosmetics.   For sensitive skin care, use soap-free cleansers and moisturizing products. In winter, take warm baths and showers using a soap-free cleanser, and use moisturizers containing petrolatum, mineral oil, linoleic acid, ceramides, dimethicone, or glycerin to prevent skin dryness. In summer, avoid direct sun exposure and use sunscreens with SPF 30 or higher containing only zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.   When consulted, dermatologists will first check for skin conditions and may conduct skin patch tests for allergies. They will also recommend milder skin care and household products. Diseases such as acne, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, rosacea, or eczema may be associated with sensitive skin.

Remission indicates that there is little or no sign of cancer in the body, and it can't be detected through X-rays, MRI scans, or blood tests. Symptoms like pain or fatigue may also subside. There are two types of remission: partial and complete. In partial remission, most cancer cells are eliminated but some remain, while complete remission means all signs and symptoms of cancer are gone.   Remission is determined through tests and scans and it means that the tumor does not grow back or stays the same size for a month after treatment. However, it does not guarantee that the cancer is gone forever, and regular checkups are necessary to ensure the disease doesn't become active again. If cancer comes back, it's called recurrence, which can happen at any time.  The journey to remission is determined by numerous factors, including the type and stage of cancer, potential side effects of treatment, age, and other health conditions. Depending on these factors, treatment plans may include aggressive treatments, medications, radiation, surgery, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, or stem-cell therapy.

The minipill contains an artificial hormone called progestin, while the combination pill includes both progestin and estrogen. Both types work by preventing sperm from reaching an egg and a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb.   However, minipills only occasionally prevent the release of an egg (ovulation). They generally have fewer side effects but may be slightly less effective in preventing pregnancy. You need to take one minipill every day, unlike combination pills which include inactive (placebo) pills.  The amount of hormones in a pill, known as the dose, can affect side effects. High-dose pills may cause breast tenderness, nausea, headaches and, rarely, blood clots. Minipills are low-dose and do not contain estrogen.  The minipill might be a good choice if you are breastfeeding, over 35 and smoke, have high blood pressure, a history of blood clots, want to avoid estrogen, or suffer from dermatitis. However, you may be advised to avoid the minipill if you have or had breast cancer, liver disease, weight loss surgery, irregular uterine bleeding, trouble taking a pill at the same time each day, or if you take certain other medications.  It's important to take the minipill every day at the same time. If you miss your usual time by more than 3 hours, the pill may not effectively prevent pregnancy.

Not all tumors are harmful; some, known as benign tumors, don't spread or cause new tumors. However, malignant or cancerous tumors can crowd out healthy cells, disrupt body functions, and use up our body's nutrients. These malignant cells can even spread to other parts of the body, a process known as metastasis, causing new tumors.  \"Cancer\" is a general term for more than 100 diseases that can affect almost any part of the body. The main types of cancer include carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Carcinomas, which are the most common, start in the skin, lungs, breasts, pancreas, and other organs. Lymphomas affect lymphocytes, while leukemia is a blood cancer that doesn't typically form solid tumors. Sarcomas occur in bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, or other soft tissues, and melanomas start in the pigment-making cells in our skin.  Despite being a known disease for thousands of years, it's only in the past century that we've gained a better understanding of what cancer really is and how it progresses. Thanks to advances in medical science, cancer specialists known as oncologists have significantly improved cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

The link between type 1 diabetes and AFib is also significant, especially in women.  The reasons for this increased risk could be due to the physical changes diabetes causes in the body, like fluctuating blood sugar levels and inflammation, which could lead to scarring and electrical changes in the heart. Type 2 diabetes may also increase fat in the upper chambers of the heart, interfering with cell communication and possibly leading to AFib.  Having both AFib and diabetes increases the risk of heart failure, blood clots, stroke, and kidney disease. Symptoms could worsen, and overall quality of life could decrease. Some people may not even realize they have AFib because the symptoms aren't always noticeable.  To manage these conditions, it's essential to follow your doctor's advice, take prescribed medications, and keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels.

Flare-ups, often triggered by irritants such as pollen, airborne dust, household cleaners, cosmetics, certain fabrics, and extreme temperatures, can lead to eczema infections if untreated.   Infections are identified by symptoms like crusts (yellow, orange, or honey-colored) on top of eczema, pus-filled blisters, open sores resembling cold sores and fever blisters, red, swollen, painful skin bumps, and spreading red streaks. These may also present with fever, flu-like symptoms, pain, and swollen lymph nodes.

To diagnose heart failure, your doctor might order tests such as blood tests, urine tests, echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, chest X-rays, and others. These tests check for issues that can cause heart failure, including anemia, thyroid problems, high cholesterol, kidney problems, diabetes, heart disease, heart attack, abnormal heart rhythms, and valve problems.  Treatment for heart failure focuses on slowing or reversing its progression. Lifestyle changes are often recommended, such as maintaining a healthy weight, increasing physical activity, reducing sodium and fluid intake, avoiding alcohol, and quitting smoking. Medications may also be prescribed to manage heart failure or the problem causing it. These may include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and others, which can help the heart pump more efficiently and control symptoms.   In some cases, surgery or a device implant may be necessary to correct problems causing heart failure, repair or replace valves, help the heart pump, or transplant a new heart. If the cost of medications is a problem, your doctor may suggest lower-priced generic medications or other options.

Its etiology is linked to an abnormal immune response where the immune system mistakenly attacks the cells lining the colon. While the exact cause remains unknown, risk factors include age, Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and family history. UC presents variably - ulcerative proctitis (the mildest form), proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis, and acute severe ulcerative colitis. Common symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, fatigue, and anemia.  Diagnosis is made via blood tests, stool samples, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, and in rare cases, X-rays. Treatment aims to ameliorate symptoms and prevent flare-ups, typically involving diet modifications, medication (antibiotics, aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics, Janus kinase inhibitors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators, and loperamide), and in severe cases, surgery.  UC can lead to complications like bleeding, osteoporosis, dehydration, fulminant colitis, megacolon, liver disease, and increased risk of colon cancer. The prognosis is typically a long-term course with periods of disease flare-ups and remission. However, about 10% of patients experience rapidly worsening disease.

The disease's management can involve the use of antibiotics due to the speculated overgrowth of bacteria as one of the causes. Antibiotics work by either killing bacteria or preventing their growth and multiplication. They can be administered in various forms such as capsules, tablets, injections, or intravenously.  In relation to Crohn's disease, antibiotics serve to manage infections, lower inflammation, reduce post-surgery recurrence, and induce remission. Common complications of Crohn's disease such as abscesses and fistulas can be treated with antibiotics. Post-surgery infections can also be prevented with antibiotics. An abnormal immune response leading to excess gut bacteria may trigger inflammation, which can be controlled by antibiotics. Antibiotics, particularly rifaximin, have shown promise in inducing remission in Crohn's patients due to fewer side effects and safer drug profile.  Antibiotics like rifaximin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin have shown significant improvement in disease activity according to a review of several studies involving more than 3,000 Crohn's patients. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are often prescribed for ileal and ileocolonic Crohn's disease and perianal Crohn's disease respectively.  However, antibiotics can cause side effects ranging from mild to serious, such as tendonitis, light sensitivity, oral thrush, QT prolongation, GI issues, permanent nerve damage, nausea, appetite loss, a metallic taste, joint pain, and muscle tightness. They may also increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection, cause a rebound effect in the gut\u2019s mucosa after stopping treatment, lead to antibiotic resistance, and lower tolerance due to side effects.  While antibiotics can trigger flares in Crohn's disease due to changes in gut bacteria balance, these can be managed through regular visits to healthcare provider, screenings, maintaining a symptom journal, regular exercise, stress management, dietary changes, and medication adherence.  Some studies suggest a link between antibiotic use and a higher risk of IBD diagnosis. Tetracycline antibiotics, commonly used to treat acne, early Lyme\u2019s disease, and traveler's diarrhea, have shown a link to IBD, particularly Crohn's disease.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

Notably, patients with UC are six times more likely to develop some form of colorectal cancer. Chronic inflammation, a prominent feature of UC, is largely responsible for this correlation. It incites damage to the genetic material of colon cells, potentially leading to cancer-precipitating mutations. Moreover, inflammation raises levels of certain molecules that aid in the growth of cancerous tumors and heightens susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections, which can further compromise the immune system and promote cancer cell multiplication.   Risk factors for colorectal cancer in UC patients include a UC diagnosis of over 8 years, a family history of colorectal cancer, severe or widespread colon inflammation, or UC leading to conditions like primary sclerosing cholangitis or dysplasia. Colorectal cancer symptoms in UC patients can mirror those of UC, making it a difficult diagnosis. Symptoms to be vigilant about include unexplained weight loss, rectal bleeding or blood in stool, persistent abdominal discomfort, changes in bowel habits, and feeling that the bowel is not completely emptying.  Early detection is key to successful colorectal cancer treatment, hence, regular colonoscopies are recommended, especially for those with severe UC or who've had UC for an extended period. Patients are advised to manage inflammation and to inform their healthcare team of any family history of colorectal cancer. Lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, and avoiding smoking and alcohol can also lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

It's a natural method that uses the hormones your body produces while breastfeeding to prevent pregnancy. It can be very effective in the first six months after childbirth if used perfectly. For it to work, you need to breastfeed your baby exclusively, not have a menstrual period, and your baby must be younger than 6 months.   However, if you use a pump or give your baby a bottle, formula, or pacifier, it might not work as effectively. LAM has its benefits as it doesn't require extra hormones, it's free, and works immediately. But it's not for everyone, especially if you have certain health conditions or can't meet the guidelines exactly.   Also, it's important to know that LAM doesn't protect against sexually transmitted diseases, so using a condom is still necessary. If you can't follow the guidelines perfectly or when your baby turns six months old, it's best to have a backup birth control method ready.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a normal person."}

These treatments can help alleviate symptoms like irritation, redness, itchiness or rash, and prevent flare-ups. But, always talk to your doctor before starting any new medication, as some may interact with your current medications.  For pain and inflammation, OTC drugs like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen may be suggested. However, these should be avoided if you have heart, kidney, liver issues, high blood pressure or other intestinal problems.  Antihistamines, taken orally, can help with the itchiness caused by eczema. These need to be taken for several weeks regularly, and some may have sedatives to help you sleep. Common OTC antihistamines include Cetirizine (Zyrtec), Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), Fexofenadine (Allegra), and Loratadine (Claritin). They can cause side effects such as dry eyes or mouth, dizziness, low blood pressure, faster heart rate, difficulty in urinating, cough, sore throat, stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting.  Topical Hydrocortisone, a low-strength steroid, can help reduce inflammation, itching, and irritation. However, they can cause side effects like itching, burning, acne, dry or cracked skin, or change in skin color.  Medicated shampoos can ease the dandruff caused by eczema. They help get rid of eczema scales or prevent the growth of yeast. Side effects are rare but can include itching, stinging, burning, hair loss, dryness or oiliness of hair and scalp, headaches, change in hair texture, or scalp boils.  Emollients, or moisturizers, improve the skin barrier to keep your skin hydrated and protected from irritants. They can also reduce the number of flares you have.

It's important to differentiate it from other conditions that resemble eczema like psoriasis, scabies, hives, allergies, ringworm, acne, contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and Netherton disease. Psoriasis and eczema both result in red, scaly patches and itching, but eczema patches tend to be thinner, and fluid can ooze from the skin. Scabies is a contagious condition caused by mites and is characterized by intense itching and rashes, while hives are red welts that usually disappear within 24 hours but can lead to swelling of the lips, eyelids, and throat. Allergies can trigger eczema but can also cause sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and swelling of the face. Ringworm is a fungal infection that leads to itchy ring-shaped patches, and acne results in several skin issues like whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, and deep-skin breakouts. Contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis are other types of eczema, causing skin irritation, inflammation, and itching.

While a male contraceptive pill is not available yet, there are several other options to prevent unplanned pregnancies. Condoms are one of the most effective options, blocking conception up to 98% of the time if used correctly. They also protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Incorrect use, however, can significantly increase the chances of accidental pregnancy.  Another method is spermicide, a chemical that kills sperm to prevent them from fertilizing an egg. It can be used alone or combined with other methods like condoms or cervical caps. However, it does not prevent STDs. Spermicide condoms are an effective form of birth control, but they have drawbacks like potential for irritation, higher cost, and shorter expiry period.  Vasectomy, or male sterilization, involves a surgical procedure to cut and seal off the tubes that sperm pass through. It's the most effective male birth control option, but it's almost permanent and doesn't protect against STDs.   Other methods include outercourse (sex or foreplay that doesn't involve vaginal penetration) and withdrawal (pulling out before ejaculation).

Exposure to certain environmental factors like wind and sun can irritate your lips, especially if you have fair skin and spend a lot of time outdoors. Certain foods and products, like makeup, mouthwash, toothpaste, and some foods can also cause irritation. Habitual behaviors like frequent lip-licking or tobacco use can remove the natural, oily film on your lips, leading to dryness and cracking. Underlying health issues, like nutrient deficiencies or conditions that weaken your immune system, can also affect your lips.  To make your lips feel better, you should avoid licking or sucking on them. Use a lip balm with petroleum jelly to seal in moisture and prevent cracks from worsening. If a product you use is causing irritation, stop using it. If your eczema is due to an allergic reaction, you can try a steroid cream. Use a lip balm with SPF 30 or more before sun exposure, and cover your lips with a scarf in the winter. If your eczema is caused by a nutrient deficiency, supplements may be helpful.

It states that around 5% of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths globally can be directly attributed to alcohol. The risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed; heavy drinkers, consuming two or three drinks daily, are the most vulnerable. Even light drinkers are at a higher risk than teetotalers.  Seven areas of the body are identified to have increased cancer risks due to alcohol: the liver, mouth, throat, esophagus, colon, rectum, and breasts. Alcohol toxicity can cause liver inflammation and scarring, doubling the chances of liver cancer. Heavy drinkers are five times more likely to develop mouth and throat cancer, as alcohol damages cells in these tissues. Alcohol consumption also increases the risk of esophageal cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. In terms of colon and rectal cancer, heavy drinking men are more susceptible than women, with an overall 44% higher risk than non-drinkers. For women, the risk of breast cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed weekly.  The document explains the harmful effects of alcohol on the cells. It converts to toxic compounds when broken down, potentially causing DNA mutations and cancer. It can also inflame organs and tissues, leading to DNA errors during the body's repair process. In women, alcohol can elevate estrogen levels, promoting cancer growth. Alcohol consumption also hampers the absorption of key vitamins and nutrients like folate, and contributes to weight gain, both of which are linked to increased cancer risk.  The document emphasizes that the type of alcoholic beverage does not influence the cancer risk, and it is unclear whether quitting or limiting alcohol reduces this risk.

However, too much of the wrong type of cholesterol (LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol) and not enough of the right type (HDL or \"good\" cholesterol) can lead to heart disease and stroke. To maintain a healthy ratio between good and total cholesterol, diet, regular exercise, and possibly medication like statins may be required.  High levels of HDL cholesterol are beneficial as it carries bad cholesterol back to the liver, removing it from the bloodstream. On the other hand, high levels of LDL cholesterol increase the risk of heart attack as excess cholesterol can build up and stick to the walls of your arteries, damaging them and forming plaque. This can lead to hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or in severe cases, heart attack or stroke.  When your cholesterol is checked, you get a total cholesterol number, and numbers for HDL and LDL cholesterol. High total cholesterol is not necessarily dangerous if it's due to high HDL cholesterol, but if it's due to high LDL cholesterol, it's important to discuss with your doctor.  Triglycerides are another form of fat in the blood which can be raised by foods high in trans fats, saturated fats, simple carbohydrates, and sugars. Eating more calories than you burn can also raise triglyceride levels. High cholesterol levels can be a risk factor for heart attack and stroke as it can cause blockages in the arteries leading to chest pain (angina).

This is different from a new cancer and can occur anywhere in your body. A recurrence usually happens when the previous treatment didn't completely destroy all the cancer cells. Some of these cells can survive aggressive therapies and grow into tumors over time.  Cancer recurrence can be in the same place as the original cancer, or in a new part of your body. Doctors categorize recurrent cancers based on where they return - local recurrence (same place), regional recurrence (nearby lymph nodes or tissues), or distant recurrence (spread to faraway organs or tissues).   It's important to note that a recurrence is different from a second cancer, which is a new cancer developing in another type of cell. Your doctor can use tests to distinguish between a recurrence and a second cancer.  Certain cancers are more likely to recur based on factors like how fast they grow or how advanced they were. For instance, about 7 out of 10 women with ovarian cancer and half of the people with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery are likely to experience a recurrence within the first 3 years.  Treating recurrent cancer can be more challenging than the first time. The treatment plan depends on the type of cancer, how advanced it is, and where it is located. Options may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or biological therapy. Clinical trials can offer access to new treatments not yet available to the public.

It affects about 47 million Americans, approximately one in six individuals, with the prevalence increasing with age and more common in specific ethnic groups such as African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American. The condition is associated with atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the arteries, which leads to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.   The American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute identify five risk factors that constitute metabolic syndrome: large waist size, high triglycerides, low good cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high fasting glucose level. To be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, at least three of these risk factors must be present.   The exact causes of metabolic syndrome are not clear, but it is considered to be a multifactorial condition. Insulin resistance, obesity (particularly abdominal obesity), unhealthy lifestyle choices such as poor diet and lack of physical activity, hormonal imbalances, and smoking have been associated with the condition.   Despite its potential health consequences, metabolic syndrome can be managed and controlled through lifestyle modifications. Early diagnosis serves as a critical alert for patients to make necessary changes to prevent serious future illnesses.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

This condition is usually treated with medication or surgery but does not have a cure. Flare-ups can occur even after treatment. Some people use probiotics and prebiotics for help.   Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that you can get from certain foods or supplements. They help by lining your bowels to prevent harmful bacteria from reaching the intestinal wall and adding good bacteria to balance out the bad. This reduces inflammation and calms the body's reaction. Specific probiotics, like E. coli Nissle and VSL#3, have been shown to help with ulcerative colitis, though results vary and more research is needed.   When taking probiotics, it's important to know that they need to be taken over a period of time to build up enough good bacteria in your gut. If you stop taking them, you might experience a flare-up.   Prebiotics, on the other hand, are foods that help the good bacteria in your colon. These include fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods. However, they may not be suitable for everyone as they can worsen symptoms for people with certain conditions.  Side effects of probiotics or prebiotics are rare and they're usually safe for most adults. However, it's always wise to consult with your doctor before starting any new supplement.

However, some people with UC experience constipation, which is less frequent, harder stool. This can be due to various reasons such as diet, hydration level, physical activity, and medication. Also, UC itself can cause certain complications that lead to constipation. About 30%-50% of people with UC sometimes have constipation.   If you have UC and constipation, you might experience bloating, belly pain, cramping, difficulty in passing stool, fewer than normal bowel movements, extra gas, dry, hard stool, and a feeling that you can't get all your stool out. These symptoms can lead to other health issues like sores in the anus or swollen blood vessels around the anus.  To manage constipation, you can make lifestyle changes such as altering your diet, staying hydrated, and regular physical activity that are safe during or after a flare. You can also train your bowels to have a bowel movement at the same time every day. If needed, therapies like biofeedback and cognitive behavior therapy can help retrain the muscles that help you poop and manage stress respectively.   If these changes aren't enough, your doctor may recommend medications and supplements to manage constipation. These can include osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, fiber supplements, and stimulant laxatives. Prescription drugs may also be an option if over-the-counter laxatives or supplements don't work.  It's normal for bowel habits to change occasionally, but if your constipation lasts longer than 3 weeks, stops you from doing daily activities, creates black stool, or causes unexplained weight loss, you should see a doctor. Also, if you have ongoing constipation with symptoms such as bloody stools, serious belly pain, vomiting, fever, or lower back pain, seek medical care immediately.

Strategies to curb biting include providing teething tools for pain relief, avoiding situations that may trigger frustration, encouraging verbal expression of feelings, providing sufficient attention, and monitoring interactions with playmates. In the event of a biting incident, immediate discipline reinforces that the behavior is unacceptable, however, retaliatory biting or hitting is discouraged as it may endorse the behavior.   Persistent or habitual biting beyond the age of 4 or 5 may signify a deeper emotional issue, warranting consultation with a healthcare provider or child therapist.

The condition often begins in infancy or early childhood and tends to run in families. Most people diagnosed as children see the condition disappear before adolescence, but some continue to experience it into adulthood.   Hormones seem to play a significant role in eczema, especially during puberty and menstrual cycles in women, due to the fluctuation of estrogen and progesterone levels. Pregnancy can also cause a flare-up due to high estrogen levels that shift the focus of your immune system. Similarly, menopause can trigger a return of eczema due to fluctuating hormones and a weakening immune system.   Stress can also cause eczema flare-ups. When stressed, your body produces hormones like cortisol which can suppress your immune system and potentially cause a flare-up.

Prior to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, the virus was responsible for a significant number of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.S. and worldwide. The virus is highly contagious, spreading through contaminated surfaces and close contact in places like hospitals and daycare settings.  Symptoms of the infection can last up to eight days and include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and frequent, watery diarrhea. Dehydration due to severe diarrhea is responsible for the hospitalizations and deaths associated with this disease.

Inflammation and ulcers in the large intestine are the primary manifestations, prompting symptoms that vary based on the severity and extent of the inflammation. Mild UC can cause symptoms such as non-bloody or bloody diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, straining during bowel movements, and constipation. Moderate UC may present with bloody diarrhea, fatigue, mild to moderate abdominal pain, and low fever. Severe UC can lead to more frequent bloody diarrhea, profound fatigue, serious abdominal pain, tachycardia, fever, and rapid weight loss.  Extra-intestinal symptoms can also occur, including skin rashes, joint pain or swelling, oral ulcers, and eye irritation. The disease course is characterized by periods of remission and flare-ups, with the frequency and severity being unpredictable. Factors that could exacerbate UC include non-adherence to medication, use of NSAIDs, stress, and certain foods.  Diet plays a crucial role in managing UC, although no universal diet is applicable to all patients. Dietary changes should be individualized, considering factors such as symptoms and medication type. Complications of UC include anemia, dehydration, weakened bones, bowel perforation, fulminant UC, toxic megacolon, and colorectal cancer. Notably, these complications are more prevalent in patients who do not adhere to their treatment plan.  Living with UC can also impact mental health, relationships, occupation, and financial situation, with the degree of impact being contingent on disease severity and management strategies.

Cholesterol is a substance made in the liver and found in certain foods, which is essential for the body. However, too much of it can increase the risk of heart disease. Factors contributing to high cholesterol can be divided into uncontrollable and controllable ones. Uncontrollable factors include gender (women's risk increases after menopause), age (higher risk for men above 45 and women above 55), and family history (those with relatives who had high cholesterol or early heart disease are at greater risk). There's also a rare genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia that causes high cholesterol from a young age.   On the other hand, controllable factors include diet (trans fats, saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol-rich food can increase cholesterol levels), weight (being overweight can raise cholesterol levels), lack of physical activity (exercise helps lower bad cholesterol and raise good cholesterol), smoking (it damages blood vessels and lowers good cholesterol), and presence of type 2 diabetes (can lower good cholesterol and raise another type of cholesterol). High blood pressure, while not directly causing high cholesterol, often co-exists with it due to shared risk factors such as lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, aging, and obesity.

While cholesterol is vital for health, an imbalance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"bad\" and \"good\" cholesterol respectively, can lead to heart disease and stroke.   LDL cholesterol can build up in the arteries, leading to atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. This can result in the formation of unstable plaques, which can provoke formation of blood clots, potentially causing heart attacks or strokes. In contrast, HDL cholesterol carries LDL cholesterol back to the liver, cleansing the bloodstream.  The cholesterol ratio, obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol, can be used as a monitoring tool. However, the American Heart Association (AHA) suggests using LDL cholesterol levels instead, as this provides a more effective guide for patient care planning and understanding health risks.  The document also discusses triglycerides, another form of fat found in the blood that can be increased through consumption of foods high in trans fats, saturated fats, simple carbohydrates, and sugar. High cholesterol and triglyceride levels pose a risk for heart attacks, strokes, and a form of chest pain known as angina.  Management strategies for high cholesterol levels include lifestyle changes like regular aerobic exercise, dietary modifications to increase HDL and decrease LDL cholesterol, and medications such as statins.

Cancer begins when cell alteration causes uncontrolled multiplication, leading to the formation of a tumor. Not all tumors are cancerous, with benign tumors not spreading to other areas or generating new tumors. However, malignant or cancerous tumors can crowd out healthy cells, interfere with body functions, and utilize body tissue nutrients. This cancer can spread via direct extension or metastasis, where malignant cells travel through lymphatic or blood vessels and form new tumors elsewhere in the body.   The term \"cancer\" represents over 100 diseases that potentially affect every body part and are life-threatening. The major cancer types include carcinomas, sarcomas, melanomas, lymphomas, and leukemia. Carcinomas, the most commonly diagnosed, originate in skin, lungs, breasts, pancreas, and other organs and glands. Lymphomas are lymphocyte cancers while leukemia is blood cancer and typically does not form solid tumors. Sarcomas arise in bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, cartilage, or other soft or connective tissues and are relatively rare. Melanomas develop from the pigment-producing skin cells.   Cancer, recognized as a human ailment for thousands of years, has only been understood by medical science in the past century. Oncologists have made significant advances in cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, leading to longer survival rates. However, some forms of the disease remain challenging to treat.

Each type has specific causes and treatments. Symptoms might vary, but typically include pain and itching in the affected area, with extreme cases potentially affecting hearing.   Contact dermatitis results from allergenic contact with substances like shampoos, makeup, jewelry, or ear drops. Atopic eczema is a result of skin sensitivity causing dryness and itchiness, which may lead to infections. This is common behind the ear or where the ear lobe meets the face. Otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, is caused by water, shampoo, or soap irritating the ear canal, or from skin damage due to scratching or using Q-tips. Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects areas with oil-producing sebaceous glands, causing red, crusty skin. Asteatotic eczema, common among the elderly, is triggered by reactions to weather changes, excessive washing, or indoor temperature changes.   For treatment, contact dermatitis can be managed by avoiding the allergen, while atopic, asteatotic, and seborrhoeic eczema may require medical-grade moisturizers or topical steroids.

Tubal ligation, a surgical procedure performed in a hospital or outpatient surgical clinic, involves the sealing or blocking of the fallopian tubes to prevent the meeting of egg and sperm, thereby preventing pregnancy. Despite its popularity (with 700,000 US women opting for it annually), it is not 100% effective and does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  A vasectomy, on the other hand, is a male sterilization procedure. This operation requires cutting and sealing or blocking the vas deferens, the tubes in the male reproductive system that carry sperm. It is almost 100% effective, presents fewer risks, and is less painful than female sterilization. Like tubal ligation, a vasectomy does not protect against STDs. The procedure doesn't impact the man's ability to achieve orgasm or ejaculate, but the ejaculate will not contain sperm post-surgery.  Post-surgery, sexual activity can resume after a few days in the case of a vasectomy, but birth control should be used until a semen test confirms the absence of sperm. Vasectomies are considered permanent, with reversal being difficult, expensive, and not always successful. Therefore, it is advised that vasectomy should only be considered by men who are prepared for the permanent inability to father a child.

Heart failure is caused by conditions that damage the heart muscle such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, cardiomyopathy, and conditions that overwork the heart. Symptoms can range from none to severe and can include congested lungs, fluid retention, dizziness, fatigue, weakened ability to exercise, rapid/irregular heartbeats, and chronic coughing.  Heart failure is diagnosed through a series of tests including blood tests, BNP blood test, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, ejection fraction, EKG, cardiac catheterization, and stress tests.  The treatment for heart failure aims to prevent its progression, alleviate symptoms, and improve the patient's quality of life. Medications used include ACE inhibitors, Aldosterone antagonists, ARBs, ARNIs, Beta-blockers, blood vessel dilators, Digoxin, Calcium channel blockers, Diuretics, Heart pump medications, Potassium or magnesium, Selective sinus node inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors.   Heart failure is also classified into four stages (A-D) by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, where stage A represents high-risk individuals and stage D represents advanced heart failure.  Lifestyle changes including smoking cessation, healthy eating, regular exercise, and regular check-ups can prevent heart failure from worsening. Certain medications should be avoided such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, some antiarrhythmic agents, most calcium channel blockers, some nutritional supplements, antacids containing sodium, and decongestants.  Surgery can be used to treat heart failure when necessary, including coronary artery bypass grafting, heart valve surgery, implantation of a left ventricular assist device, or heart transplant. The management of heart failure requires a team approach with the patient being an active member of the team. Emergency care should be sought for symptoms such as severe chest pain, fast heart rate, shortness of breath, sudden weakness, severe headache, and fainting spells. The prognosis for heart failure patients depends on the function of the heart muscle, the patient's symptoms, and response to treatment.

Needle biopsy involves the extraction of the sample with a special needle, while open biopsy requires a piece of bone to be removed through an opening in the skin. This type is chosen when a larger sample is required.   Preparation for the procedure involves signing a consent form and informing the doctor about any medications or supplements taken, allergies, pregnancy, or bleeding problems. Some blood tests may be conducted and patients might be asked to stop taking blood thinners a few days prior to the biopsy, and to fast for 8 hours before the test.   The procedure can be conducted in a hospital or doctor's office, with the patient in a gown. To prevent pain and induce relaxation, medication is given. During the biopsy, patient's heartbeat and blood pressure are monitored. The biopsy area is numbed and a small cut is made over the bone. In a needle biopsy, a thin needle is used to extract a small sample of cells or tissue. For a core needle biopsy, a larger needle is used to extract a bigger piece of bone. In an open biopsy, a piece of bone is removed after making a small cut in the skin.   Post-procedure, the patient is moved to a recovery room and vital signs are monitored. The procedure area may be sore for up to a week and pain relief can be provided. The sample is sent to a lab for microscopic examination, which can take up to a week.   Possible complications include bleeding, infection, nerve or blood vessel damage, and bone fracture. Patients are advised to contact their doctor if experiencing symptoms such as fluid draining from the biopsy site, fever, or pain. The biopsy can detect the presence of a tumor in the bone and whether it is cancerous. The results are then discussed with the patient.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a doctor."}

This method is more popular than birth control pills, with 18.6% of women choosing it. The process involves blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes, making it a safe, convenient, and highly effective form of birth control. However, despite being considered permanent, there are exceptions and pregnancy can still occur, sometimes many years after the operation. The type of surgical method and the age at which the operation is performed can influence the chances of getting pregnant.  Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy can occur after tubal ligation. This happens when a fertilized egg implants and starts to grow outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This can lead to serious internal bleeding and requires immediate medical attention.  While tubal ligation is generally permanent, it can be reversed in some cases. The success of reversal depends on factors like the health of the fallopian tubes, the woman's age, and the type of surgery used initially. However, for women over 40, in-vitro fertilization, where a fertilized egg is placed directly into the womb, might be a better option.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a patient."}

There are other conditions that might mimic eczema, like psoriasis, scabies, hives, allergies, ringworm, acne, and certain types of dermatitis. These conditions might bring on similar symptoms but have different causes and characteristics. For example, psoriasis is due to immune system malfunction, scabies is caused by tiny mites, and hives usually disappear within 24 hours. Allergies can flare up due to different triggers like pet dander, dust mites, or certain fabrics. Ringworm is a fungal infection that forms ring-shaped patches, while acne has different forms including whiteheads, blackheads, pimples, and cysts. There are also other types of eczema like contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis, which can also cause skin irritation and itching.

These are a type of contraceptive that can help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). They work by creating a barrier that keeps sperm out of the uterus.   The female condom, also known as an internal condom, is made of nitrile rubber or lab-made latex. It is inserted into the vagina before sex and removed afterwards. Importantly, each condom can only be used once.   When using a female condom, it's essential to ensure that the package isn't damaged, the condom hasn't expired, and it's used for the entire duration of sex. It shouldn't tear and should stay in place throughout intercourse.   Female condoms are about 95% effective when used correctly, meaning around 5 out of 100 women using them perfectly for a year might still get pregnant. If not used correctly, the chance of pregnancy increases. They can't entirely eliminate the risk of STDs but can significantly reduce it.   One of the advantages of female condoms is that they can be bought without a prescription and can be inserted up to 8 hours before sex. They can fit a range of penis sizes and can be used with any lubricant. On the downside, they have a higher failure rate compared to male condoms, can be hard to find, and may be more expensive. They can also cause discomfort, potential allergic reactions, and possibly urinary tract infections if left in too long.   If your healthcare provider prescribes female condoms, they should be covered by insurance, including Medicaid in some states. However, in the U.S., the only FDA-authorized female condom, FC2, is only available with a prescription. These can be obtained via telemedicine, and condoms may be available at health clinics, nonprofits, and online, but not on e-commerce sites or in sex shops.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a patient."}

If you or your family members have a history of eczema, asthma, or seasonal allergies, you're at a higher risk. Also, children born to older women or those living in urban, high-pollution, or colder climates are more likely to develop eczema.   It's important to know that eczema isn't contagious, and it's not caused by food allergies, although some kids with eczema also have food allergies.   Certain triggers can cause eczema to flare up or worsen, including skin irritants like wool, man-made fibers, soaps, perfumes, makeup, dust, chlorine, environmental irritants, and cigarette smoke. Infections, cold or flu, allergic reactions to mold, pollen, or pet dander, or stress, can also trigger flares.

It involves skin inflammation and can look like a rash. There are many types of eczema, and it often flares up when your skin comes into contact with certain irritants like pollen, dust, perfumes, and certain fabrics or extreme temperatures.   When eczema gets worse or is untreated, it can become infected. Signs of an eczema infection include yellow, orange, or honey-colored crusts on the skin, pus-filled blisters, open sores similar to cold sores, red and painful skin bumps, and spreading red streaks. If you have any of these symptoms along with fever, flu-like symptoms, or pain, you should seek immediate medical attention.  To treat an eczema infection, doctors typically take a skin sample to identify the bacteria causing the infection. Depending on the type of bacteria, you may need topical or oral antibiotics, antiviral medication, or anti-fungal cream.   Preventing future infections is important once your eczema has healed. This can be done by avoiding irritants, moisturizing your skin, and covering eczema with clothing to prevent exposure to bacteria. If you have recurring skin infections, it might be worth discussing with your doctor, as there might be other factors contributing to your eczema.  People with eczema are more prone to other conditions like asthma, hay fever, food allergies, other skin infections, and mental health conditions.

During the tests, you'll be asked to drink the barium solution and lie in various positions to allow the barium to spread around. The tests usually take around 30 minutes to an hour and may cause some discomfort like cramping or a strong urge to have a bowel movement.   After the tests, you can return to your daily activities and diet. You might notice a white or light stool for up to 3 days after the test, this is normal. The results of the tests usually come within a day or two.   There are minimal risks associated with these tests, but repeated tests within short intervals can increase exposure to radiation. If you're pregnant or suspect you might be, it's better to discuss with your doctor about other safer tests. Also, if you notice any unusual symptoms after the tests like high temperature, a change in bowel habits, or worsening pain, it's important to contact your doctor immediately.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a patient."}

Pain relievers like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen can help with symptoms of burning, inflammation, and pain. These are generally safe, but people with certain health conditions should avoid them.   Antihistamines can help with itching by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance that causes itchiness. These should be taken for several weeks regularly. Some antihistamines have sedatives to help with sleep. Side effects can include dry eyes, drowsiness, blurred vision, headache, and low blood pressure among others.  Topical hydrocortisone is a low-strength steroid that reduces inflammation and itching and provides temporary relief. It's typically used one to four times a day for up to a week. Side effects can include itching, burning, and changes in skin color.  Medicated shampoos can help with dandruff caused by eczema. Side effects are rare but can include itching, burning, and changes in hair texture.  Emollients (moisturizers) can improve the skin barrier and help with dryness.

It's important to note that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is different from these diseases and does not usually lead to toxic megacolon.  Less commonly, toxic megacolon can be caused by infections from viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Certain illnesses or medications that reduce blood flow to your bowel might also cause it. People with conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, a transplanted organ, or problems with your immune system are more prone to get toxic megacolon.  Symptoms include severe diarrhea, often with blood, fever, dizziness, swollen belly, and a fast heartbeat. If you notice these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical help immediately as the condition can worsen quickly. Diagnosis typically involves examining your symptoms, health history, and conducting tests like X-rays, CT scans, and blood tests.  Treatment varies depending on the seriousness of the condition, your symptoms, age, general health, and the cause of the condition. Medications like steroids, immune system drugs, or antibiotics may be used. In some cases, you might be put on bowel rest, where you receive nutrition through a needle or a tube instead of food to reduce pressure on your colon.

Medication can help bring your heart back to a normal rhythm, prevent such clots, and reduce the risk of stroke.  People with AFib often have high blood pressure as well, which pushes hard on the artery walls and can also lead to strokes. Hence, maintaining a healthy blood pressure level is important. The document mentions a CHADS2 score, which helps doctors assess a person's stroke risk based on factors like heart failure, high blood pressure, age, and diabetes.  Continual fast beating of the heart can weaken the heart muscle and lead to a condition called cardiomyopathy. Medicines like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can prevent this by slowing the heart rate.  AFib can also lead to heart failure due to the heart beating too fast and not pumping blood effectively. Maintaining a healthy blood pressure and weight, not smoking, and controlling blood sugar are suggested to lower the risk of heart failure.

Even a small weight loss can make a difference. Simple changes like drinking water instead of soda can help you start.  Alcohol consumption should be moderated, as alcohol is converted to cholesterol and triglycerides, substances that increase your risk of heart problems or stroke. Men under 65 should limit themselves to two drinks a day, while women and men over 65 should stick to one.  Stay active, aiming for at least 150 minutes of activity each week. This doesn't have to be all at once - any movement counts. If you smoke, try to quit, as smoking damages your arteries and makes them more susceptible to cholesterol build-up.  Regular testing is important as high cholesterol doesn't have symptoms. A blood test is the only way to know if you have it.

The procedure is done under anesthesia, typically takes 2-4 hours, and you can usually go home the same day. The recovery takes about 2 weeks. Success rates can decrease with each reversal. It might be considered by men who want to start or add to their family, or by those experiencing pain from the original vasectomy. Side effects are rare but could include bleeding, infection, or persistent pain. You'll know the procedure was successful if sperm appears in your semen after a few months. The reversal should not affect your sex life, but it's recommended to wait 2-3 weeks to have sex after the surgery.

It emphasizes that no single fruit or food can prevent or cure cancer, but certain types can aid in managing the side effects of treatment and potentially possess anticancer qualities. For instance, canned fruit, applesauce, peaches, and other soft fruits can help with nausea and vomiting, while raw fruits, dried fruits, and prune juice can alleviate constipation. Bananas and apples as part of the BRAT diet can help manage diarrhea, and high-calorie foods like dried fruit and fruit smoothies can address loss of appetite.   Citrus fruits such as grapefruits and oranges may play a preventative role against certain cancers like digestive tract cancer, respiratory tract cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and cutaneous melanoma. Apples and other white fruits such as pears, mushrooms, and onions may reduce the risk of lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other digestive tract cancers. This is potentially due to the presence of polysaccharides and quercetin in apples.   Green fruits, including kiwifruit, honeydew melon, and green grapes, may offer protection against colorectal cancer, with kiwifruit specifically noted for its antioxidant properties and promotion of a healthy gut. Regular consumption of dried fruits such as prunes and raisins may help ward off some types of cancer while also potentially preventing the worsening of existing cancers.   Research is ongoing into plant chemicals found in pineapples, orange fruits, and pomegranates that may have cancer-preventive benefits. Regardless, these fruits are high in fiber, which can help reduce the risk of certain cancers and maintain a healthy weight.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a doctor."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/diseases-linked-high-cholesterol", "category": "heart_disease", "perspective": "patient", "summary": "patient : The document discusses the health risks associated with high cholesterol which include cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When cholesterol levels are too high, it could lead to the formation of fatty plaques in arteries, which can block blood flow and cause diseases.  There are different types of cholesterol, some bad and some good. The bad cholesterol (LDL) can cause your arteries to become narrow or blocked when there's too much of it, leading to strokes or heart problems. On the other hand, the good cholesterol (HDL) can help protect against heart disease. However, low levels of HDL, especially alongside high levels of LDL, could also contribute to heart disease. Another thing to consider is triglycerides, which are fats from food that circulate in your body. While not a type of cholesterol, their levels are measured alongside HDL and LDL to determine risk of atherosclerosis.  High cholesterol can cause coronary heart disease, which can lead to a heart attack by building up cholesterol in the walls of your arteries, forming plaques that harden and restrict blood flow. These plaques can also affect arteries leading to your brain, potentially causing a stroke. Symptoms can also be experienced in the legs due to cholesterol plaque.  For diabetics, there can be an imbalance between HDL and LDL. People with diabetes tend to have LDL particles that stick to arteries and damage blood vessel walls easily. If you have low levels of good cholesterol but high levels of bad cholesterol and high triglycerides, you have a condition called diabetic dyslipidemia.  High cholesterol can also cause high blood pressure, or hypertension, and erectile dysfunction. It seems to trigger inflammation and the release of certain hormones that causes blood vessels to tighten up, which elevates blood pressure. In terms of erectile dysfunction, high cholesterol seems to narrow the smaller blood vessels of the penis, impeding blood flow necessary for an erection.  To lower your cholesterol and reduce risks, you can make lifestyle changes such as improving your diet, quitting smoking, increasing exercise, and taking prescribed medications. Foods like oatmeal, walnuts, tuna, salmon, sardines, and tofu are recommended, while those high in trans fats, saturated fats, and simple sugars should be avoided. Even modest amounts of exercise can help control weight and lower triglyceride levels, while raising HDL cholesterol. If required, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a patient."}

Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chances of curing cancer. Some types of cancer can be self-detected through routine self-exams. However, most cancers are diagnosed when a tumor can be felt or when symptoms develop. The diagnosis involves physical exams, lab studies, imaging tests, and biopsy.  If cancer is confirmed, further tests are performed to understand the spread and stage of the disease. Treatments can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy, depending on the type and stage of cancer.  Supportive care, including pain relief and emotional support, is essential for maintaining the quality of life of patients. Exercise and mind/body therapies can also help control symptoms and improve quality of life.   Diet and nutrition are important, but no specific diet has been proven to cure or slow cancer. Complementary therapies like acupuncture and acupressure can be beneficial for managing symptoms, but they do not cure the disease. The use of herbal remedies and homeopathy should be done with caution, as their effectiveness isn't proven and they can interfere with standard treatments.  Having social support and spiritual practices can help manage the depression, fear, and anxiety associated with cancer. At-home care, including gentle skincare after radiation therapy, light meals to avoid nausea, and relaxation techniques, can also be beneficial.

Eczema, usually referring to atopic dermatitis, often presents in childhood with symptoms generally improving by teenage years, though it may persist into adulthood. The disease is now understood as a problem with the skin's outer layer rather than a simple allergic reaction.  There's a significant connection between eczema and allergic conditions, with up to 80% of eczema-affected children developing hay fever or asthma later in life, and a 37% prevalence of food allergies in children with moderate to severe eczema.   Research reveals that individuals with eczema have a genetic flaw leading to a lack of proteins (filaggrin and loricrin) that form the skin's protective outer layer. The deficiency results in skin dryness, itchiness, and vulnerability to irritants and allergens. There's also an abnormal reaction of the body to allergens, leading to inflammation, and elevated levels of Immunoglobulin E, an antibody involved in allergic responses.  Management strategies involve daily moisturization, medication adherence, and avoidance of allergens. Recommendations include allergy testing, maintaining an eczema journal, avoiding skin irritants, using a moisturizer, and for infants, breastfeeding and delaying solid foods where there's a high risk of allergies.

Some people may experience flares that come and go throughout their life, while others may go weeks or even years without symptoms - a period known as remission. Regular communication with your doctor is important to managing your UC effectively.  People with UC are at a slightly higher risk of developing colon cancer, especially if the disease is left untreated. This is due to the ongoing inflammation which can cause changes in your colon cells, potentially leading to cancer. Factors such as uncontrolled inflammation, being male, having a liver condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis, or having a family history of colon cancer can increase this risk. However, modern medicine and regular screenings have improved the outlook for UC patients.  Possible complications of UC include bleeding, dehydration, nutrient loss, inflammation in parts other than the digestive tract, perforated bowel, eye, and skin problems, and in rare cases, toxic megacolon.

Unlike other diseases, there's no absolute cure for cancer, but there are treatments that can help manage it. Each type of cancer starts in a different part of your body and has its own stages, symptoms, and rate of growth.   When doctors talk about a \"cure\" for cancer, it means that the treatment has successfully removed all signs of cancer, but it's not a guarantee that the cancer won't return. This is due to the complex nature of cancer and the fact that some cancer cells might remain in the body and grow again. When your cancer seems to disappear after treatment, you might say you are \"cured\" or more accurately, your cancer is in \"remission\", which means symptoms have gone away, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cancer won't come back.  There are many types of treatments for cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, bone marrow transplant, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted drug therapy, clinical trials, and palliative care. The choice of treatment depends on the type of cancer, its stage, your overall health, and your preferences.  While there's no absolute cure for cancer yet, research is continually making progress. There are now more treatment options than there were even 5 years ago. In addition to medical treatments, some non-medical practices like acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga can help manage side effects like fatigue, nausea, and pain.  If you're considering alternative treatments, it's important to discuss this with your doctor and ask important questions about the effectiveness, risks, benefits, and FDA approval of the treatment.

The diagnostic process includes a thorough medical history review and a physical exam, where the doctor may check blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, as well as perform a digital rectal exam to check for blood in the stool.   Blood and stool tests are conducted to check for anemia, a symptom of UC, and other infections. An increase in white blood cells, low level of albumin and an elevated C-reactive protein level detected in blood tests indicate inflammation.   Endoscopic procedures like sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are performed to visualize the large intestine. In a sigmoidoscopy, a sigmoidoscope is used to examine the rectal lining and lower large intestine, while a colonoscopy allows for an examination of the entire colon and potentially a biopsy.   Imaging techniques such as X-ray and CT scan might also be used to rule out other conditions and detect complications from UC. A CT enterography uses contrast material to enhance the visibility of the intestine in X-ray images. An MRI, which uses strong magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body, may also be used. However, the approach may need to be adjusted for patients with a pacemaker, tattoos, heart valves, metal screws, pregnancy, or certain health conditions.

However, experts believe it to be a combination of various factors, including immune system issues, genetics, environmental conditions, and changes in gut bacteria.   In terms of the immune system, typically, our body's defense system fights harmful substances while ignoring beneficial ones such as certain microbes involved in digestion. In Crohn's disease, the immune system may mistakenly attack these helpful microbes or go into an indefinite state of defense, causing continuous inflammation in the digestive system that can lead to ulcers and injuries to the intestines.  Genetically, it has been observed that if you have a family member with Crohn's disease, you are slightly more likely to develop it yourself. A specific gene associated with Crohn's disease has been identified, and if this gene is mutated, it may affect your body's reaction to microbes, potentially leading to the development of Crohn's disease over time.  Environmental factors like diet, exposure to bacteria or viruses, and cigarette smoke may also trigger Crohn's disease. These factors might either trigger an unstoppable immune response or directly damage the lining of the intestines, accelerating the onset of the disease.

Lymph nodes are small organs distributed throughout the body that play a key role in filtering out harmful substances, including germs. Biopsies can help diagnose cancer or identify infections that might explain certain symptoms, like swollen lymph nodes.  There are several types of lymph node biopsies: 1. Sentinel lymph node biopsy: Used to check if an existing cancer, like melanoma or breast cancer, has metastasized. Sentinel lymph nodes are the first ones that cancer travels to when it spreads. The doctor locates these nodes via the injection of a radioactive substance or blue dye into the area near the tumor. The nodes are then removed under general anesthesia.  2. Fine needle aspiration: This procedure is similar to a blood sample, where a thin needle with a hollow center is used to extract fluid and cells from a lymph node. Local anesthesia is applied, and the patient can usually go home the same day.  3. Core needle biopsy: Similar to fine needle aspiration but using a larger needle to extract a small block of tissue for examination.  4. Open biopsy: More like a minor surgery, where the doctor makes an incision to remove all or part of a lymph node.  Post-biopsy, the lymph node or a sample of it is sent to a pathologist for examination under a microscope. The timeframe for results varies and depends on the type of biopsy performed and whether any additional tests are required.

This test can help differentiate between autoimmune diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and is instrumental in diagnosing vasculitis, an autoimmune disease that impacts blood vessels.  The ANCA test detects two primary types of ANCAs: pANCA, which targets a protein called myeloperoxidase, and cANCA, which targets a protein known as proteinase 3. ANCA tests use either indirect immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods to identify these autoantibodies.  The ANCA test may be recommended when there's uncertainty between a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, as their symptoms are often similar. Up to 80% of people with ulcerative colitis test positive for pANCA, and the protein PR3 is more common in children with ulcerative colitis than those with Crohn's disease. Additionally, the ANCA test can predict a patient's response to IBD medicines called tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.

Eggs, despite their high cholesterol content, are rich in vitamins, iron, and protein. Sardines, while high in cholesterol, are beneficial due to their omega-3 fatty acid content. Shellfish like shrimp have high cholesterol but are also rich in B vitamins, protein, selenium, and zinc. Lean meats like skinless baked chicken or lean ground poultry meat are healthier options than red meats due to their lower fat content.   The document also addresses the debate between grass-fed and grain-fed beef, concluding that there is no significant difference in cholesterol levels if the fat content is the same. However, grass-fed beef contains more omega-3 fatty acids, but also more saturated and trans fat.   The overall recommendation is that occasional indulgence in high-cholesterol foods is acceptable provided the overall diet is healthy and balanced.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

CAD occurs when plaque builds up in the walls of arteries that supply the heart, potentially leading to chest pain and heart attacks. In the U.S., CAD causes approximately 805,000 heart attacks and 696,000 deaths per year.   Risk factors for heart disease are divided into uncontrollable and controllable. Uncontrollable factors include gender, age, family history, postmenopausal status, and race. Controllable risks revolve around lifestyle choices such as smoking, unhealthy cholesterol levels, uncontrolled high blood pressure, physical inactivity, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, stress, depression, anger, poor diet, and alcohol use.   To lower heart disease risk, lifestyle modifications are recommended. These include quitting smoking, improving cholesterol levels, controlling high blood pressure, controlling diabetes through diet, exercise, weight management, and prescribed medication. Regular physical activity and a heart-healthy diet low in sodium, fats, cholesterol, and sugars, but high in vitamins, antioxidants, and plant-based foods, can also help lower the risk.

Anal fissures are small tears in the rectal lining, common in Crohn's disease, and might be the first symptom. They are usually due to chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract lining, and patients tend to have several fissures, typically on the sides of the rectum. Hemorrhoids, swollen blood vessels in the rectum, are less common in Crohn's disease, and are usually due to diarrhea or constipation related to the disease.  Anal fissures symptoms include bleeding, deep ulcers, and pain especially during bowel movement. Hemorrhoid symptoms can include bright red blood during defecation, mild fecal incontinence, mucus, wetness or fullness feeling in the rectal area and skin irritation.  These conditions are diagnosed through physical exams, digital rectal exams, and procedures like anoscopy or proctosigmoidoscopy. Treatments for anal fissures include warm sitz baths, topical anesthetics, and prescription creams like nifedipine or nitroglycerin. If fissures persist, it may be due to active inflammation from Crohn's, requiring more targeted medical therapy.  Hemorrhoids are initially treated similarly to non-Crohn's patients, with high-fiber diets, warm baths, and oral phlebotonics. However, surgery, often used for hemorrhoids, is not recommended for Crohn's patients due to potential complications like sepsis, fistulas, fecal incontinence, and non-healing wounds.

There are a few eye conditions linked to UC, including Episcleritis, Scleritis, Uveitis, and Keratopathy.  Episcleritis is the most common and it involves inflammation of the outer coating of the white of your eyes, causing redness, pain, and tenderness. Its severity often correlates with the severity of the inflammation in your gut. Treatment usually involves managing the inflammation of UC, but eye drops and topical drugs can also be used.  Scleritis affects the white part of your eye and can cause symptoms like pain, redness, swelling, blurry sight, and sensitivity to light. It can lead to vision loss if not treated promptly. Treatment options include steroid pills or eye drops, NSAID drugs, eye solutions or antibiotics, drugs that lower your immune system, or surgery.  Uveitis is a serious condition involving inflammation of the middle layer of your eye wall. It can cause pain, blurry vision, sensitivity to light, and eye redness, and can lead to permanent damage or vision loss if untreated. Treatment usually involves steroid eye drops or dilation drops.  Keratopathy is a rare complication affecting the clear, outer layer of your eye, causing dryness. It can usually be treated with lubricants and artificial tears.  Some medications for UC can also cause eye complications, such as Cataracts and Glaucoma. These conditions can be managed with surgery or medication. Retinopathies, diseases that damage the part of your eye that senses light, are rare but can occur due to certain biologic drugs that treat UC.

Foundation: It contains moisturizers, colorants, and fillers with differences in composition based on the type (powder or liquid). Foundation for dry skin includes glycerides, squalane, and oils, while those for oily skin use absorbent powders. Hyaluronic acid, peptides, and botanicals are used to hide fine lines. It is recommended to use a sponge for application and discard the foundation after 12-18 months.  2. Blush: Composed of FDA-approved colorants, fillers, and concealing pigments. It needs to be applied considering face structure. Its shelf life is around 12 months.  3. Lipstick: Contains wax, pigment, and oil. The quantity of oil determines the intensity of the color. Long-wear lipsticks use volatile solvents. Hybrid lipsticks are a cross between a balm and a gloss. Lipstick should be replaced after a year due to potential preservative breakdown.  4. Mascara: Composed of iron oxide, triethanolamine, waxes, polymers, and a preservative. Waterproof formulas use silicone. Extra product should be wiped off the mascara brush before application to avoid clumps. Claims about lash-enhancing botanicals are doubtful. Mascara should be replaced every four months.  5. Eye shadow: Main ingredients are talc and mica, along with binders, bismuth oxychloride, dimethicone, and iron oxides. Cream shadows add waxes and oils to the base. Stick shadows require a balance of waxes, binders, pigment, and emollients. Pressed-powder eye shadow can last two years, while cream or stick varieties should be discarded after six months.

If the doctor suspects AFib, they will listen to your heart and may order tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the treatment. This might involve seeing a cardiologist or an electrophysiologist, who are doctors specializing in heart conditions and irregular heartbeats.   When visiting your doctor, it's best to prepare by noting down your symptoms, medication list, and any questions you might have. The doctor will ask about your health habits, problems, and family medical history, and they'll likely listen to your heartbeat, take your pulse and blood pressure, and listen to your lungs.  To diagnose AFib, doctors often use an Electrocardiogram (EKG), a simple, non-invasive test that records the heart's electrical activity. However, because AFib might not always show up on a standard EKG, you might need to use a portable heart rhythm monitor like a Holter Monitor or an Event Monitor for a longer period.   Other diagnostic methods include Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (a device that monitors your heart continuously), a stress test (which observes your heart under physical stress), and an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart).

However, having high levels of cholesterol, particularly \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL), can increase your chances of heart disease. This is because LDL can stick to your blood vessel walls, leading to clogged arteries, which can cause heart attacks. Another fat, known as triglycerides, can also increase your chances of heart disease and stroke, especially when paired with low levels of \"good\" cholesterol (HDL). High triglyceride levels also increase the risk of diabetes.  The American Heart Association recommends cholesterol testing for everyone over the age of 20. The test measures your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Depending on the results, it may be necessary to make changes in your lifestyle or start taking prescription drugs to manage your cholesterol levels.  A diet that is low in saturated fat and simple carbohydrates and includes fiber and plant sterols can help lower LDL cholesterol. Regular aerobic exercise can also help lower LDL and raise HDL. If you smoke, quitting can also improve your cholesterol levels.  If lifestyle changes are not enough, medications such as statins, niacin, fibrates, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors, and triglyceride medications can be prescribed. In severe cases, LDL apheresis, a blood-cleansing procedure, may be used.

These birth control methods, such as pills, patches, rings, shots, implants, and intrauterine devices, release synthetic versions of hormones estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy.   One of the common effects is that your breasts may feel a bit swollen or look bigger, similar to the changes that happen around your period. This is due to the hormones causing your body to retain fluids, resulting in water being trapped in your breast tissues. This is usually temporary and should subside in a few months.   Birth control can also cause breast tenderness or pain which can feel like a heavy or sore sensation that may also affect your armpit or upper arm. This is normal around your period, but the hormones from birth control can make the pain more intense.   There could be other side effects as well, such as headaches, breast tingling, irregular periods, mood changes, a decrease in sex drive, acne, and nausea. These are typically not serious and should go away once your body adjusts to the birth control. Over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen can help manage the pain.  Before starting hormonal birth control, it's recommended to talk to your doctor.

LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\", is the main contributor to these plaques. High cholesterol, smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes can damage the endothelium, the lining of blood vessels, allowing cholesterol to infiltrate the artery wall. Plaque formation occurs when white blood cells digest LDL cholesterol over time, creating a toxic mass in the artery wall.   Cholesterol plaques can behave in different ways: remain within artery walls, grow slowly into the path of blood flow, or rupture suddenly, causing blood clots leading to heart attacks or strokes. They are also linked to coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease.   Prevention focuses on lifestyle changes and medication, targeting risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, abdominal obesity, stress, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity. Aspirin, a clot-preventing agent, can be beneficial for people at higher risk.   Treatment options include statins, fibrates, niacin, and bile acid sequestrants to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and drugs like aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel, and warfarin to reduce the risk of blood clots.

Some older children may also need PCV13. The second vaccine, PPSV23, is for children aged 2 and above, and it protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria.   Pneumococcal disease can cause several serious illnesses, including bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, otitis media, bacteremia, and sinus infections. There are over 6,000 deaths annually in the U.S. due to pneumococcal disease, with more than half of those deaths occurring in adults who should have been vaccinated as per CDC recommendations.  Both vaccines are safe, with only mild side effects reported, such as redness, tenderness, swelling, fever, and occasional fussiness, drowsiness, or loss of appetite. The PCV13 vaccine is recommended for all infants younger than 24 months via a series of four doses. Healthy children aged 2-4 years who didn't complete the four doses should receive one dose of the PCV13 vaccine. The PPSV23 vaccine is recommended for any adult aged 19-64 who smokes or has asthma and anyone aged 2-64 who is on immunosuppressive therapy or has certain health conditions.   Adults aged 65 and older are advised to get both the PCV13 and PPSV23 vaccines due to the high mortality rates from bacteremia and meningitis caused by invasive pneumococcal disease in the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.

It may occur due to heavy drinking, stress, or certain health conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, or an overactive thyroid gland. AFib episodes can last anywhere from a few minutes to permanently, and treatments vary depending on the type of AFib you have.  There are several types of AFib, each linked to specific causes and durations. For instance, Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation lasts less than a week and may not require treatment, while Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation lasts for more than a year and often requires treatments like medication or a procedure called ablation. Permanent Atrial Fibrillation is uncorrectable by treatments and may require long-term medication.  AFib can be diagnosed through tests like blood tests, electrocardiograms, and chest X-rays. The treatments for AFib include medications, surgeries, or medical devices like pacemakers. Medications aim to slow your heart rate, bring your heart's rhythm back to normal, and prevent blood clots. If medications don't work, procedures like Electrical cardioversion or Ablation might be used.  Adopting a healthy lifestyle can also help manage AFib. This includes eating healthy food, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and caffeine, exercising regularly, and managing stress. AFib can cause complications like stroke, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and fatigue, so it's important to manage these risks.  Over 2 million Americans have AFib, and it's more common in people aged 60 and older. Certain medical conditions like long-term lung disease, overactive thyroid gland, sleep apnea, and certain medicines can increase the chances of having AFib. Symptoms of AFib include feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering in your chest, feeling fatigued or weak, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, experiencing chest pain or pressure, and shortness of breath.

Around 30% of children with AD may test positive for a food allergy. The most prevalent food allergies related to AD are cows' milk, egg, peanut, soy, tree nuts, wheat, fish and shellfish, and sesame.   An Allergen-Specific IgE Test, which measures the level of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood, is used to detect food allergies. Increased IgE levels can indicate an allergy. However, the test cannot definitively diagnose a food allergy, and false positives are possible.   The test is recommended for children under five who exhibit clear reactions to certain foods or whose AD symptoms do not improve with treatment. It may also be suggested if current treatments are ineffective, if there's a high chance of a serious allergic reaction, if severe AD interferes with skin testing, or if a serious allergic reaction has occurred within the past month.  Other testing methods include skin prick tests, oral food challenges, elimination diets, and atopy patch tests. However, the choice of testing method depends on multiple factors including cost, risk, and personal preference.  The document also differentiates between allergies, intolerances, and sensitivities. Allergies trigger a specific immune response affecting multiple organs, intolerances involve difficulty digesting certain foods, and sensitivities cause discomfort without an allergic or intolerant reaction.

It's common, affecting about 1 in 6 people, and becomes more likely as you age or if it runs in your family. It's also more common in certain ethnic groups.  These risk factors can lead to conditions like atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up in the arteries, potentially leading to heart attacks or strokes. It also increases the risk of developing diabetes. The syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these risk factors.  The exact causes of metabolic syndrome aren't clear, but it's likely due to several factors. These include insulin resistance, where your body produces insulin but doesn't use it effectively, leading to higher blood sugar levels and potentially diabetes. Obesity, particularly excess fat in the belly, is also a factor. A poor diet and lack of physical activity, hormonal imbalances, and smoking can all contribute.

It's important to use them correctly to ensure they are effective. If used properly, they are about 95% effective at preventing pregnancy.   Advantages of female condoms include their availability without prescription, the ability to insert them up to 8 hours in advance, suitability for various penis sizes, and compatibility with all types of lubricants. They also have a few disadvantages, such as a slightly higher failure rate compared to male condoms, being harder to find in stores, potentially being more expensive, and possibly causing discomfort or allergic reactions.   If you have health insurance, you may be able to get female condoms for free if they are prescribed by your healthcare provider.

It contrasts the minipill with combination birth control pills which contain both progestin and estrogen. Both types of pills prevent pregnancy by preventing sperm from reaching an egg and an fertilized egg from implanting in the womb, and by altering the mucus and uterine lining. However, minipills only occasionally suppress ovulation, a feature that combination pills consistently exhibit.  The document provides a comparison between high-dose and low-dose birth control, with the difference being the amount of hormones contained. The text states that most combination pills and all minipills are low-dose, with combination pills potentially leading to increased side effects like breast tenderness, nausea, headaches, and in rare instances, fatal blood clots due to the presence of estrogen.  The minipill is recommended for individuals who are breastfeeding, over 35 and smoke, have a history of high blood pressure or blood clots, wish to avoid estrogen, or have dermatitis. However, it may not be suitable for those with a history of breast cancer, liver disease, recent weight loss surgery, irregular uterine bleeding, difficulty sticking to a strict pill regimen, or those taking certain medications.  The minipill must be taken every day, at the same time each day. If not taken within a 3-hour window of the usual time, its effectiveness may decrease.

Doctors in this field, known as surgical oncologists, can remove harmful tumors from your body, check if you have cancer, and determine if the disease has spread elsewhere in your body. They work with your regular doctor to develop a treatment plan that could involve surgery to remove cancerous tumors and tissue, or to conduct biopsies to confirm whether you have cancer and how advanced it is.  Surgical oncology can be beneficial in the early stages of cancer or when the condition is more advanced. You might need surgical intervention to prevent cancer, especially if you have a high risk of developing the disease in a certain part of your body. Surgical oncologists can remove precancerous tissue to prevent the onset of cancer.   Surgery can also be used to confirm if you have cancer by removing tissue for examination under a microscope, a process known as a biopsy. Additionally, surgery can help to determine the severity of the cancer, by looking at the size of a tumor and checking if it has spread to other parts of your body, like lymph nodes or other organs.  There are different types of surgeries used in treatment: curative (removing the entire tumor), debulking (removing as much of the tumor as possible if it's too risky to remove all), and supportive (procedure to help other cancer treatments work better).  Surgical oncologists can also perform surgeries to ease symptoms of advanced cancer and improve your comfort, even if the cancer cannot be completely removed. This is known as palliative surgery.   After surgery to remove tumors, your body might look and feel different. In these cases, surgical oncologists can perform reconstructive surgery to restore the look and function of areas affected by cancer.  Surgery is not suitable for all types of cancer, but it can effectively treat many types, including cancers of the breast, esophagus, throat, thyroid, skin, lung, gallbladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, spine, uterus, bones, and colon.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a patient."}

It's important to note that EC doesn't induce an abortion and is ineffective if the individual is already pregnant. The primary types of EC include hormone-based pills (like levonorgestrel-based Plan B One-Step and Preventeza), non-hormonal pills (such as Ella containing ulipristal), and intrauterine devices (IUDs) like the copper-T IUD. The most effective form of EC is the copper IUD, which also serves as a long-term birth control method.  EC works by delaying or stopping ovulation. Hormone-based pills block the release of eggs, Ella blocks key hormones necessary for conception, and IUDs prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. These methods are most effective when administered soon after intercourse, with levonorgestrel-based pills being most effective within three days post-intercourse, while Ella and IUD can work up to five days after sex.  Certain medications and supplements, like epilepsy medications, specific antibiotics, and St. John's wort, may interfere with the efficacy of EC. EC pills are generally available without a prescription, though some types like Ella do require one.

It can sometimes go away on its own, but certain types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, or cancer of the anus or penis. There are over 100 kinds of this virus, some of which cause warts on the hands or feet, and others that are sexually transmitted and may lead to serious health problems.  HPV strains can be high-risk like HPV 16 and 18 which cause about 70% of cervical cancers, or low-risk like HPV 6 and 11 which cause about 90% of genital warts and rarely develop into cancer. HPV doesn't always cause symptoms, but when it does, it may result in warts on the genitals, hands, fingers, feet, and other body parts.   HPV is contracted through skin-to-skin contact, or vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Certain risk factors increase your chances of getting HPV, such as having many sexual partners, damaged skin, a weak immune system, or coming into direct contact with someone else's wart.  Diagnosis typically involves a doctor examining your warts, but other tests like the vinegar solution test, Pap test, and DNA test can also be used. Treatment options for warts include medications like salicylic acid, imiquimod, or podofilox, and procedures like cryotherapy, electrocautery, surgery, or laser surgery.  The only way to completely avoid HPV infection is to abstain from sexual activity. However, there are vaccines available (Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil-9) that protect against some high-risk types of HPV.

Key nutrients include healthy fats, particularly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which contribute to skin elasticity and moisture. They also offer protection against skin cancer and inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat, are crucial for cell wall development.  Proteins, or more specifically their building blocks, amino acids, are essential for the creation of collagen and keratin that structure the skin. They also facilitate the shedding of old skin and protect against UV rays and free radicals.  Vitamins A, C, and E play vital roles in skin health. Vitamin A prevents sun damage and aids in the functioning of oil glands around hair follicles, while vitamin C supports collagen structure and acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E, also an antioxidant, absorbs UV light energy, preventing skin damage, and works in tandem with vitamin C to strengthen cell walls.  Zinc, found abundantly in the outer skin layer, aids in skin healing and cell division. It may also protect against UV damage and act as an antioxidant. Selenium, another mineral, assists antioxidants in protecting the skin from UV rays, and its deficiency could increase skin cancer risk.  The document advises the consumption of fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, leafy dark greens, eggs, flaxseeds, legumes, avocados, and extra virgin olive oil for their high content of skin-friendly vitamins, antioxidants, and nutrients.

To manage it, consistent skin moisturization and protection are recommended. There are three types of moisturizers: ointments, creams, and lotions. Ointments like petroleum jelly provide the best skin protection as they are thick and trap water into the skin, providing a barrier against irritants. However, they may feel greasy. Creams are less greasy but may contain preservatives that can cause skin reactions. Lotions are not as effective as they are thinner, containing a lot of water that can evaporate and dry out the skin. It's recommended to test new moisturizers for potential skin reactions.  Proper bathing habits are also crucial. Shorter, lukewarm showers using gentle, scent- and dye-free cleansing products are advised. After showering, the skin should be patted dry gently and immediately sealed with a thick cream or ointment to retain moisture.  If the skin breaks open, it may lead to infections characterized by severe redness, itching, oozing clear or yellow fluid, blisters, pus-filled bumps, fever, and swollen glands. Antibiotic or antifungal creams or ointments can be used to treat these infections.

It highlights a phenomenon known as the 'atopic march,' where a sequence of related conditions typically follows atopic dermatitis, the most common type of eczema. The initial condition in this sequence is food allergy, experienced by about 15% of children aged 3 to 18 months with atopic dermatitis. Common allergens include peanuts, milk, wheat, soy, and eggs, causing symptoms from itchy mouth and swollen lips to severe reactions like a sudden drop in blood pressure.  In the progression of the 'atopic march,' asthma and allergic rhinitis often follow eczema and food allergies. Asthma affects around 20% of adults with atopic dermatitis, presenting with difficulty breathing due to swelling and narrowing of the airways. Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, is triggered by allergens like pollen, dust, and pet dander, causing symptoms such as watering eyes, sore throat, sneezing, and a runny nose.  The document further discusses the potential connection between eczema and allergic contact dermatitis, an irritation that occurs when the skin comes into contact with a triggering substance. This reaction is delayed and develops into a rash as the immune system responds. Skin damage from eczema might weaken the body's defenses, making it more susceptible to irritating substances and potentially exacerbating the body's response, especially with the use of topical medicines containing steroids.  Lastly, a link between eczema and mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, is noted. Eczema may lead to social isolation and dissatisfaction with life quality, both contributing to mental health problems.

Though vasectomies can be reversed multiple times, the success rate may decrease with each reversal.  The procedure is recommended for men who wish to start or expand their family or who suffer from post-vasectomy testicular pain. Side effects are rare but can include scrotal bleeding, infection, and severe or persistent pain. Success is measured by the return of sperm in the semen, which can take 6-12 months after a vasovasostomy, or possibly longer than a year after a vasoepididymostomy. The success also largely depends on the type of original surgery and the presence of any other fertility issues. The procedure should not affect the patient's sex life, although doctors recommend abstaining from sexual activity for 2 to 3 weeks post-operation.

It can affect both children and adults, and while it comes and goes, there's no known cure. Symptoms usually start before the age of 5 and can include very itchy, red rashes mainly on the back of the neck and knees, and in elbow creases. They can also thicken and darken the skin if scratched a lot.   The cause of atopic dermatitis isn't clear, but it tends to run in families and is likely if there's a family history of allergies, hay fever, or asthma. Living in cold areas or places with high pollution, and experiencing stress can increase the risk of getting it. However, it's not contagious.   Triggers that can cause a rash or make it worse include strong soaps and detergents, some fabrics, certain skin care products, and foods.   Doctors diagnose it by asking about your medical history, doing a physical exam, and possibly conducting a skin patch allergy test. They treat the symptoms with medications like steroid creams or ointments, antihistamines, antibiotics, and in some cases, drugs to suppress your immune system.   At home, you can ease your symptoms by taking warm oatmeal baths, using a humidifier, not scratching your skin, and wearing loose clothing. For babies, use bath oils and creams after a bath to keep their skin moist.   There can be complications like asthma, skin infections, irritant hand dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and sleep issues due to itching.   To prevent flare-ups, avoid your known triggers, keep your skin moisturized, limit your showers to 10 minutes, use warm water instead of hot, use mild soaps, and take care of your skin.

Diagnosis can occur during a routine check-up or following specific symptoms such as fluttering heartbeat or fatigue. The first step in diagnosis involves listening to the heart to detect irregularities. Further tests may be required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause. Referrals may be made to cardiologists or electrophysiologists who specialize in heart diseases and arrhythmias.  During the examination, the doctor will inquire about the patient's symptoms, health habits, health problems, and family medical history. Physical examinations will include listening to the heartbeat's rate and rhythm, taking pulse and blood pressure, and listening to the lungs.  The Electrocardiogram (EKG) is instrumental in diagnosing AFib as it records the heart's electrical activity, revealing the speed, rhythm, strength, and timing of electrical signals passing through the heart. However, as standard EKG is a quick snapshot, it may not always capture AFib, necessitating the use of portable heart rhythm monitors like the Holter Monitor or Event Monitor.  Other diagnostic tools include Mobile Cardiac Telemetry, Stress Test, Echocardiogram (including Transthoracic and Transesophageal echocardiogram), Blood Tests, and Portable Electrocardiogram. Fitness trackers with photoplethysmographic sensors can also detect AFib.   An Electrophysiology Study can provide a deeper understanding of the cause of the abnormal heartbeat and guide treatment plans. This procedure involves inserting a flexible electrode into a blood vessel leading to the heart, usually via the neck or groin, and measures the heart's electrical signals.

Combined Hormonal Contraception comprises methods like birth control pills, vaginal rings, and patches. They are about 99% effective if used correctly, but may cause blood clots, especially in smokers over 35. Benefits include lighter periods, less cramping, and lower risk of uterine and ovarian cancer.  Progestin-only Pills work by thickening cervical mucus and thinning the uterus lining. They may result in an ectopic pregnancy and have side effects like irregular periods, tender breasts, acne, lower sex drive, depression, headaches, nausea, and ovarian cysts.  The Progestin Arm Implant, inserted under the skin, is almost 100% effective and lasts up to 3 years. It may cause irregular bleeding, which usually lightens or stops after 6-12 months.  IUDs, either copper or plastic, are inserted into the uterus and remain effective for 3-10 years. Copper IUDs may cause painful, heavy periods but are hormone-free, making them suitable for breast cancer survivors. Hormonal IUDs can result in irregular or light bleeding, acne, headaches, tender breasts, mood changes, and pelvic pain.  Depo-Provera, a progestin form, is administered as an injection protecting against pregnancy for 12-15 weeks. It has a 99% effectiveness rate but may cause irregular bleeding and potential weight gain.

In AFib, the atria (upper chambers of the heart) quiver instead of squeezing strongly, leading to poor blood pumping and potential blood clot formation. These clots can travel to the brain and result in a stroke.  Medicines are used to manage AFib, including those that normalize heart rhythm, prevent clot formation, and mitigate stroke risk. A significant percentage of AFib patients also have high blood pressure, which can increase stroke risk, hence the importance of maintaining blood pressure within a healthy range through diet, exercise, and medication.  AFib can also lead to cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle becomes too weak to pump enough blood due to persistent fast beating. Medicines like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can help prevent this condition by slowing the heart rate.  Heart failure can also result from AFib due to the inadequate pumping of oxygen-rich blood. Managing blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and controlling blood sugar (for diabetic patients) can reduce the risk of heart failure.

AFib results from abnormal electrical activity in the heart, leading to a quivering or irregular heartbeat. This condition can elevate heart failure risk and increases the possibility of stroke due to blood clot formation resulting from poor blood flow.   AFib risk factors include high blood pressure, heart disease, and endocrine disorders. The endocrine system, controlling hormones, can affect heart health when hormone levels are too high or low. Notably, Diabetes and Thyroid disease are significant endocrine disorders linked to AFib. Uncontrolled glucose levels in diabetes can scar the atria, affecting their electrical activity, while abnormal thyroid hormone levels can alter heart rate, contributing to AFib. Additionally, disorders in the adrenal glands producing hormones like aldosterone, cortisol, and adrenaline can also influence AFib risk.   Patients diagnosed with endocrine disorders or experiencing changes in hormone levels due to menopause or other reasons need to consult their doctors about potential heart risks. Regular check-ups for cholesterol, blood pressure, and electrocardiograms may be suggested.   Other non-endocrine related factors increasing AFib risk include age, excessive alcohol consumption, family history of AFib, uncontrolled high blood pressure, and other heart conditions.   AFib symptoms can be mild or hard to ignore, with common ones including a feeling of a fluttering heart, irregular heartbeat, fatigue, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, and sweating. AFib can be persistent or paroxysmal, requiring different treatment methods based on its duration and severity.   AFib treatment often involves medications like anticoagulants to reduce the risk of blood clots, rate-control medications to regulate heart rhythm, and rhythm-control medications to restore a normal rhythm. Other treatments include ablation and electrical cardioversion for severe cases.   The prognosis for AFib indicates a shortened life expectancy by approximately two years compared to those without AFib. However, with proper treatment and a heart-healthy lifestyle, patients can manage the condition effectively.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

It spreads predominantly through contaminated food and drink, causing between 19 and 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually in the U.S. alone, leading to over 450,000 emergency room visits. It's responsible for more than half of all foodborne disease outbreaks annually.  The incubation period of Norovirus is 12 to 48 hours, with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle ache, and fatigue. Prolonged vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which is particularly risky for children, older adults, and those who are malnourished. The virus can be shed for 2 weeks or more after infection, meaning individuals can remain contagious even after symptoms have subsided.  Norovirus is not related to flu but is often confused with it due to similar symptoms. Infection occurs through consumption of contaminated food and beverages, touching virus-laden surfaces, or close contact with infected individuals. It thrives in environments like restaurants, daycare centers, and nursing homes due to its hardiness and high contagiousness.   Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms, but can be confirmed by a stool test. Due to its viral nature, noroviruses do not respond to antibiotics, and there is no antiviral drug treatment. Management is symptomatic, involving hydration, rest, and bland foods. Complications are rare, but dehydration can occur, especially in vulnerable groups.  Prevention relies on good hygiene, particularly handwashing, careful disposal of contaminated items, thorough washing and cooking of food, especially shellfish, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, especially after someone has been sick.

Spermicides, chemicals that prevent pregnancy by killing sperm, can be used alone or in conjunction with other methods like condoms. However, they do not prevent STDs.   A vasectomy is the most effective method of birth control for men, but it's largely permanent and doesn't protect against STDs. Outercourse refers to other sexual activities that don't involve penetration, thereby eliminating the possibility of pregnancy, but STDs can still be transmitted.

Controllable risk factors encompass dietary habits (trans fats, saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol increase LDL cholesterol levels), weight (overweight individuals have higher LDL and lower HDL levels), physical activity (increased exercise lowers LDL and increases HDL), smoking (damages blood vessels, promotes fatty deposits, and lowers HDL), and Type 2 diabetes (can lower good cholesterol levels and raise triglycerides). High blood pressure often coexists with high cholesterol due to shared risk factors such as lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, aging, and obesity. Both conditions are risk factors for heart disease, which is the leading cause of death from high cholesterol.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

Symptoms can vary widely depending on the person and which part of the gastrointestinal tract is affected.  The disease can also cause symptoms that affect overall health, including fatigue, fever, mouth sores, night sweats, and unusual menstrual cycles. Complications can occur, affecting either the intestinal tract locally or the entire body systemically.  Common complications include abscesses, fissures, fistulas, malabsorption and malnutrition, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and strictures. Other complications can involve the joints, skin, bones, eyes, kidneys, and liver. In children, physical development problems such as growth failure and delayed puberty can occur.  While there is no cure for Crohn's disease, various treatments can manage the symptoms and complications. These treatments range from antibiotics, steroids, immune system drugs, and surgery, to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.  Crohn's disease is often confused with another condition called ulcerative colitis. The symptoms are similar, and both involve periods of active flare-ups followed by remission.

It involves a man withdrawing his penis from a woman's vagina before ejaculation to reduce the chances of sperm entering. However, it requires a high level of control and timing, and it's not as easy as it seems.   To improve its effectiveness, the document suggests using it in conjunction with other forms of birth control like condoms or the pill, using a spermicide, and avoiding reliance on withdrawal alone during the woman's most fertile days. The man should urinate before sex to clear out any early sperm, and the method should be used consistently.   However, this method is not very reliable, with an effectiveness rate of about 78%. This means that 22 out of 100 women could get pregnant in a year of using this method. It also does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).   The benefits of this method include its immediate availability, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. It does not involve the use of hormones or other chemicals, does not have side effects or health risks, and does not require a doctor's prescription.   On the other hand, the disadvantages include the high level of control required by the man, the lack of control on the woman's part, potential interference with sexual pleasure, and the possibility of sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid even if the man urinates before sex.

In a traditional vasectomy, the doctor makes small incisions in the scrotum, cuts the tubes, and then seals them off. The no-scalpel vasectomy involves a small puncture, resulting in less bruising and swelling and a faster recovery. Both procedures are performed under local anesthesia and take about 30 minutes.  After the procedure, the body continues to produce sperm but they are no longer part of the ejaculation. It's important to note that the vasectomy isn't fully effective until several months after the procedure, as remaining sperm can live in the body for many weeks. Doctors recommend using another form of contraception until they confirm the absence of live sperm, typically 90 days after the procedure. Vasectomies are highly reliable, with fewer than 1% failing.

The government recommends these vaccines, and although they're not mandatory, most schools require kids to be vaccinated.   Vaccines work by exposing your body to a germ in a controlled way so your body can learn to fight it. This not only protects your child but also everyone they come into contact with.   Here are some common vaccines and the diseases they prevent:  - Hepatitis B vaccine: Protects against Hepatitis B, a virus that can damage the liver. Your child may have already received the first dose in the hospital, and there are two more doses to follow.  - Rotavirus vaccine: Protects against a virus causing diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in babies. The vaccine is recommended at 2 and 4 months.  - Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine (DTP): A combined vaccine protecting against three serious diseases. Diphtheria swells up the throat, tetanus tightens the muscles painfully, and pertussis makes it hard for kids to breathe. This is a five-dose series given at different ages.  - Hib vaccine: Protects against Haemophilus influenzae type b, bacteria that can cause an infection damaging a baby's brain and hearing. The vaccine is given in four doses.  - Pneumococcal vaccine: Protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause meningitis, pneumonia, and some ear infections. The vaccine is given in four doses.  - Polio vaccine: Protects against polio, a disease that used to paralyze people. Now children are vaccinated against it at different ages.  - MMR vaccine: A combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. These diseases can cause various severe health problems, including brain swelling and birth defects.  - Chickenpox vaccine: Protects against chickenpox, a disease that could cause serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.  - Hepatitis A vaccine: Protects against a serious liver disease. The vaccine comes in two doses.  - Meningococcal conjugate vaccine: Guards against four different strains of bacteria that can cause deadly infections of the brain and bloodstream.  - Human papillomavirus vaccine: Protects against a group of viruses causing nearly all cases of cervical cancer and most cancers of the vulva, penis, anus, rectum, and throat.  - Influenza vaccine: Recommended for everyone every year, starting at 6 months.

The process can provide vital information about the type of disease you might have and the appropriate treatment for it. Depending on the type of cancer and how much it has developed, there could be various symptoms. For instance, lung cancer could cause a bad cough, or you might notice blood in your urine if you have bladder cancer.   Doctors use different tools to determine if you have cancer, including checking for biomarkers (substances in your blood that could indicate cancer) or imaging tests (pictures of the inside of your body to spot lumps or growths). These markers could be raised levels of certain proteins or changes in genetic material. For example, prostate cancer has a specific marker known as PSA, but high levels of PSA can also be due to other conditions, so a biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.   Imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, MRIs, or PET scans can help detect unusual growths inside your body. However, these tests can only provide limited information as there are many benign tumors that look like cancerous growths. Thus, if your doctor suspects cancer from imaging, they will usually follow up with a biopsy.   There are ongoing efforts to find new ways to diagnose cancer as accurately and as early as possible. One such is a liquid biopsy, which involves a deep analysis of bodily fluids like blood and urine for signs of cancer. However, this technology is still in the early stages and a traditional biopsy is typically used to confirm the diagnosis.  If you are at risk for a certain type of cancer or if cancer runs in your family, it's important to tell your doctor.

If your doctor suspects you have AFib, they might listen to your heart, ask about your symptoms and health habits, and possibly refer you to a heart specialist for further tests.  Tests could include an electrocardiogram (EKG), which records your heart's electrical activity, a Holter monitor that you carry around for 24 to 48 hours to record heart activity, or an event monitor that records heart activity only at certain times over a 30-day period. Some patients might also use mobile cardiac monitoring or undergo a stress test, which examines how your heart responds to exertion.  Another test, an echocardiogram, creates a moving picture of your heart using sound waves. This helps the doctor understand the size and shape of your heart, how well the heart muscle and valves are working, and if there are any blood clots.  Blood tests can help pinpoint what might be causing your AFib, checking for things like infection, thyroid and kidney problems, or signs of a heart attack. Portable EKGs and fitness trackers can also be useful to monitor your heart rhythm.  Lastly, an electrophysiology study could be done, where a flexible electrode is inserted into a blood vessel leading to your heart to measure electrical signals. This can help doctors understand what's causing the irregular heartbeat and determine the best treatment.

It can cause limb loss, hearing loss, nervous system problems, intellectual disability, seizures, and strokes. The disease is not as contagious as the flu, but it can spread through contact with infected respiratory and throat secretions. It's particularly risky for family members and caregivers of an infected person, as well as college students living in dormitories.  Fortunately, there are vaccines available that can help prevent this disease. They work by triggering your body's immune system to produce antibodies that can attack and kill the bacteria if it enters your system. The vaccines are safe and do not contain live bacteria. They are around 85-90% effective in preventing meningococcal disease. However, they do not protect against all strains of meningitis, and it is still possible to contract meningitis from a different strain not covered by the vaccine.   The vaccines are recommended for children ages11 or 12, with a booster between ages 16 and 18. Certain groups, like college freshmen living in dorms, military recruits, and people with certain health conditions, should also get the vaccine.   Side effects from the vaccine are generally mild, such as redness or mild pain at the injection site, or a mild fever. There have been very rare instances of a serious nervous system disorder (Guillain-Barre syndrome) reported after receiving the vaccine, but it is unclear whether the vaccine was a factor.

Both conditions can lead to heart disease and stroke, and often occur together in a condition known as metabolic syndrome, which also increases your risk for diabetes.  High cholesterol can cause deposits to build up along the walls of your arteries, causing them to narrow and stiffen. This makes it harder for your heart to pump blood, which can increase your blood pressure. On the other hand, high blood pressure can cause damage to your artery walls, which can lead to cholesterol build-up.  You can manage these conditions with lifestyle changes, including eating a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetable oils. It's also beneficial to limit intake of saturated fats, red meats, processed foods, and sugary foods and drinks. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also help lower both cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

The most common symptoms experienced by women before their periods include irritability, depression, and mood swings, known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Birth control pills, patches, and rings often contain lab-made hormones, estrogen and progestin, that prevent the body from ovulating.   Some women have reported mood-related side effects such as depression and anxiety since the introduction of the pill in 1960. However, research has been inconsistent in establishing a direct link between hormonal birth control and these symptoms.   On the other hand, hormonal contraceptives can help manage the discomfort experienced by many women during their monthly periods. Symptoms of PMS can include anger, depression, sleep issues, tenderness, aches and pains, bloating, and weight gain. A specific type of hormonal birth control pill has been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of PMS, known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder.   The document suggests that some women might perceive a link between birth control hormones and mood swings due to heightened sensitivity to hormonal changes, stress related to pregnancy prevention, and pre-existing mental health conditions.

The symptoms can vary significantly depending on the specific type of eczema. Common symptoms include open sores, blisters, fluid on the skin, redness, crusting, and itching, burning, or soreness on the skin. In severe cases, symptoms like fever, fatigue, achiness, chills, and swollen lymph nodes may be present.   Weeping Eczema is caused by skin inflammation leading to heavy swelling, dilation of blood vessels, and leakage of serum into the skin's soft tissues, causing edema. This condition can be exacerbated by infections, with Staph being the most common form of infection. Although eczema itself is not contagious, the secondary infections associated with it can be transmitted.   Diagnosis involves a thorough skin check to confirm the presence of eczema, followed by blood tests, a skin biopsy, a bacterial culture, or allergy tests to ascertain that the symptoms are indeed due to eczema.   Treatment depends on the cause and typically includes antihistamines for itchiness, corticosteroids to treat itchiness and swelling by reducing inflammation, and immunosuppressants to lessen the overactive immune response. Other treatments may be required in case of secondary infections. Home remedies may also be beneficial, including baths (colloidal oatmeal or diluted bleach), vitamins and supplements (Vitamin D, B12, and fatty acids), probiotics, and oils (coconut, olive, sunflower seed oil).

The radionuclides used in these scans release low levels of radiation and can be administered orally or intravenously. The type of scan used depends on the specific details the doctors are looking to visualize. For instance, Bone scans are used to detect cancer spread to the bones, while Gallium scans can help spot cancer throughout the body. MUGA scans are used to assess heart functionality, and PET scans help determine the growth rate of cancer cells. Thyroid scans, which involve the intake of radioactive iodine, assist in the detection of thyroid cancer.  Nuclear medicine also provides various treatment methods for cancer, such as Radioimmunotherapy, Radioactive iodine therapy, Brachytherapy, and Y90 radioembolization. Radioimmunotherapy combines radiation and immunotherapy and is often used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that doesn't respond to chemotherapy. Radioactive iodine therapy destroys the thyroid gland and cells without causing harm to the rest of the body. Brachytherapy involves the localized delivery of high radiation doses and is used for various types of cancer. Y90 radioembolization is a specific treatment for liver cancer, involving the direct release of radiation into the tumor.

Both conditions may have similar symptoms but are triggered by different factors. AD is a chronic condition that can occur at any age but primarily begins in early childhood. It's associated with a gene mutation leading to a deficiency of filaggrin, a protein that forms a barrier protecting the skin. This deficiency causes the skin to become more porous, allowing moisture to escape and making it susceptible to irritants and allergens. AD is also linked with other allergies like hay fever or asthma and has a tendency to run in families.   On the other hand, CD is an allergic reaction to a substance that comes in contact with the skin, causing inflammation. It is not linked to genetic factors or other allergies and does not run in families. However, certain occupations that require frequent contact with detergents or chemicals may increase the risk of developing CD.   The triggers for AD and CD may include soaps, detergents, dust, pollen, sweat, stress and certain metals. For AD, flares can occur sporadically, even after years of remission, whereas CD flares occur rapidly after contact with the irritant and can last for weeks.   Diagnosis for both conditions involves physical examination, patient history, symptom analysis, and potentially a patch test to identify specific triggers. Treatment strategies include avoiding known triggers, maintaining skin moisture, avoiding scratching, using prescribed topical agents, and taking oral medications in severe cases.

Dry skin and eczema share common symptoms of scaly, itchy, and red skin. Dry skin is a common condition that can be triggered by various environmental factors such as a cold climate, indoor heating, long hot showers, frequent hand washing, harsh soaps, or detergents.   Eczema, affecting approximately 12% of children and 7% of adults in the US, is a condition caused by a combination of genetic factors, a faulty immune response, and environmental triggers, resulting in a dysfunctional skin barrier. Its symptoms are often triggered by allergens like food, pet dander, pollen, tobacco smoke, pollutants, stress, harsh soaps and detergents, and rough fabrics like wool.   While dry skin doesn't cause eczema, it can trigger symptom flares in individuals already at risk. It's important to differentiate between the two, with eczema usually presenting as red or gray patches, bumpy skin with blisters that ooze fluid and then form a crust, cracked or scaly skin, and thick and raw skin from scratching.   Treatment for dry skin focuses on environmental changes and moisturizing, whereas eczema may require medication, including over-the-counter antihistamines, hydrocortisone, prescription topical medicines such as steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, and in severe cases, systemic medications like Methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporine, biologic drugs, and Janus kinase inhibitors.   In cases where dry skin or eczema symptoms do not improve with treatment, worsen, or result in open cuts or sores from scratching, it is advised to consult with a medical professional.

Metastatic cancer retains the name of the original cancer, such as metastatic breast cancer. Types of cancer like breast, prostate, lung, kidney, and thyroid are more likely to metastasize to the bone. The process of metastasis involves cancer cells invading nearby tissue, circulating through the lymphatic system and bloodstream, and forming smaller tumors at a distant location. Once in the bone, these cells must evade the immune system, which can lead to variations in the new tumor compared to the primary tumor, making treatment more challenging.  Bone metastasis symptoms include bone pain, broken bones due to the metastasis weakening them, symptoms from excess calcium in the blood due to bone destruction by the tumor, and neurological symptoms from vertebra metastases causing spinal cord compression.  The primary method of treating bone metastasis is treating the primary cancer, usually through chemotherapy or hormone therapy.

Surgery can serve different purposes such as complete treatment, pain relief, or to enable other treatments. The type and frequency of surgeries depend on factors such as cancer type, its advancement, treatment plan, and the need for reconstructive surgery.   There are different types of surgeries:   1. Diagnostic surgery, also known as a biopsy, is used to confirm if a tumor is cancerous. An incisional biopsy removes a piece of the suspicious tissue while an excisional biopsy removes the entire area. The sample is then sent to a pathologist for examination.  2. Staging surgery determines the size of the tumor and the extent of cancer spread. This usually involves removal of lymph nodes near the tumor. Laparoscopy is a common staging procedure.  3. Curative surgery aims to remove the entire tumor along with some healthy surrounding tissue. This could be the only treatment required, or may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation if cancer has spread.   4. Debulking surgery removes part of a tumor when removing the entire tumor may cause damage. This is often followed by other treatments like radiation therapy or chemotherapy.   5. Palliative surgery is used to alleviate symptoms in advanced cancer cases and improve quality of life, not as a cure.   6. Supportive surgery assists in other treatments, for instance, by inserting a catheter for medication delivery, or a feeding tube for nutrition.  7. Reconstructive surgery restores body appearance or function after the primary surgery. This could be conducted simultaneously with the primary surgery or later.   8.

Around 800,000 young Americans under 40 have AFib. It can be linked to other heart problems, but sometimes it appears alone, especially in younger people, and could indicate a serious, undiagnosed heart condition.   You might be more prone to AFib if you have a family history of the condition, partake in extensive intense exercise, have other health conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, or if you smoke, consume a lot of caffeine, alcohol, or deal with high stress levels.   Healthy lifestyle choices are crucial for younger people diagnosed with AFib. This includes giving up smoking, eating healthily, managing stress, and regular exercise. AFib can be of different types, some of which might go away quickly while others might persist or become permanent.  While AFib is usually not fatal, it can lead to complications, the most serious being the risk of a stroke. If you think you might be at risk of having AFib, it's important to speak to a doctor quickly.   AFib treatment involves preventing strokes, controlling your heart rate and rhythm, and possibly surgery if drugs don't work.

It can cause Hib disease, an invasive bacterial infection that was once the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children. This infection can result in fever, cognitive decline, coma, and potentially death. Serious nerve and brain damage, ranging from blindness to paralysis to intellectual disability, can occur even if children survive the infection.   Aside from meningitis, Hib can also cause pneumonia, epiglottitis, blood infection, bone infection, and joint infection leading to arthritis. The Hib germ is spread via droplets from sneezing or coughing. Prior to the use of the Hib vaccine, there were about 20,000 cases of Hib disease each year in children under age 5, 12,000 of which were meningitis, resulting in about 1,000 deaths per year.  Hib is spread from person-to-person through coughs and sneezes. Those most at risk are young kids under 5, adults over 65, individuals with compromised immune systems, and certain ethnic groups. Symptoms of Hib depend on the disease it causes, and can range from ear infections and cellulitis to bronchitis, pneumonia, meningitis, epiglottitis, septicemia, and septic arthritis.  Diagnosis of Hib is through the use of at least one lab test, such as blood, joint fluid, spinal fluid, pleural fluid, or middle ear aspirate. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, but in serious cases, hospitalization and additional treatments such as IV steroids, breathing support, drugs to treat low blood pressure, wound care, and drainage surgery may be required.  The Hib vaccine, available since 1992, provides safe and effective protection against Hib disease. It is recommended for children under age 5, with the first dose ideally given at age 2 months. The number of doses required for full immunity varies based on the type of vaccine used. If an adult or older child is at increased risk and has never been vaccinated, at least one dose of the vaccine is needed for protection.

Approximately 60 of these variants cause warts on areas such as hands or feet, while around 40 can enter the body during sexual contact, targeting the body's mucous membranes.  High-risk HPV strains, including HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, are associated with approximately 70% of cervical cancers. On the other hand, low-risk HPV strains like HPV 6 and 11 account for about 90% of genital warts, which rarely develop into cancer. The symptoms of low-risk HPV infections are primarily warts, which vary in presentation depending on the HPV type.  HPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, or vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Risk factors for HPV infection include damaged skin, direct contact with warts, having multiple sexual partners, age (children are more likely to get common warts while genital warts are more common in adolescents and young adults), and a weakened immune system.   Diagnosis can be determined through physical examination or tests, including the vinegar solution test, Pap test, and DNA test. Treatment options include medications like Salicylic acid, Imiquimod, and Podofilox. Other interventions include Cryotherapy, Electrocautery, and surgical procedures.

This can lead to health complications like stroke and heart failure. Stroke can occur when blood clots form in the heart due to the irregular rhythm, and these clots can travel to the brain causing a blockage of blood flow.   Medications are often used to restore normal heart rhythm, prevent clot formation, and reduce the chances of a stroke. Factors such as congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, age, and diabetes can increase the risk of a stroke.  AFib can also lead to a condition called cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle becomes weak due to fast beating, reducing its ability to pump blood effectively. Certain medications like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can help prevent this.  Heart failure is another complication of AFib. It can result from the heart's inability to pump enough oxygen-rich blood, which can lead to fatigue and fluid buildup in the lungs. Managing blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and controlling blood sugar (if diabetic) can help minimize the risk of heart failure.  AFib can also contribute to memory loss and is associated with increased dementia risk, possibly due to insufficient blood supply to the brain.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, tends to increase with age and is more prevalent in individuals over 60 years. The risk of developing hypertension is elevated in individuals with obesity or a family history of the condition. The disease is especially dangerous due to its asymptomatic nature, often being undiagnosed in 1 in 3 Americans with the condition.   Hypertension can lead to many complications, including aneurysms, heart enlargement, kidney failure, and vision problems due to the abnormally high pressure exerted against artery walls. Multiple factors, such as diet, stress, lack of physical activity, being overweight, and genetics can contribute to its development.   Blood pressure is typically measured using a cuff wrapped around the upper arm, providing two numbers, systolic and diastolic pressure. Readings of 130/80 or higher on at least two occasions indicate hypertension. Readings of 180/120 or higher warrant immediate medical attention.   The document also introduces the concept of \"prehypertension,\" a slightly elevated blood pressure that increases the risk of arterial, heart, brain, and kidney damage. About 75 million Americans are classified under this category, which, despite lacking evidence of long-term benefits, many physicians believe should be treated.   Hypertension is also associated with certain lifestyle factors, including a diet high in salt, being inactive, overweight, heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, and some medications.   In 95% of reported cases, the cause of hypertension is unknown, referred to as essential hypertension, which appears to be influenced by lifestyle and genetic factors. Secondary hypertension, on the other hand, is when a direct cause can be identified, such as kidney disease or certain adrenal gland conditions.   Hypertension can be treated with a range of medications, including diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers.

They can also help reduce inflammation in the gut by controlling the immune response and bacterial growth. Antibiotics may even reduce the recurrence of symptoms after surgery and help induce remission.   The most commonly prescribed antibiotics for Crohn's disease are metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, which have shown to be effective at treating different types of Crohn's disease. However, like all medications, antibiotics can cause side effects ranging from mild to serious, so it's important to discuss any concerns with your doctor.   In managing Crohn's flares that antibiotics may cause, some practical steps include regular visits to your healthcare provider, maintaining up-to-date health screenings, keeping a journal of your symptoms, adhering to your medication schedule, incorporating regular exercise, quitting smoking, practicing stress reduction techniques, and maintaining a healthy diet.   Lastly, some studies have suggested a link between antibiotic use and an increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's, particularly in children who took antibiotics in their first year of life. However, further research is needed to fully understand this potential connection.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a patient."}

It is a safe and comforting place, not a punishment or time-out method. This corner typically includes activities and tools that help children calm down, such as coloring books, sensory items like weighted blankets, fidget objects, visual stimulation items, and books.   The document suggests that adults should monitor children in the calm-down corner, check in on them periodically, and provide positive feedback. The calm-down corner should be accessible to all children and be free from distractions.   The benefits of such a corner include helping children become aware of their emotions and teaching them how to identify and regulate these emotions. It also helps them improve their communication and relationship skills.   While setting up a calm-down corner, one should ensure that it doesn't become a place to avoid chores or classwork, or a space dominated by one child. It's also advisable not to allow stimulating electronics in the corner. The corner should be in a quiet but not completely isolated spot, with comfortable seating and calming tools.

This disorder, affecting around 4%-5% of children aged 7-11 in the U.S., can interfere with normal activities and cause significant distress. Symptoms may include an unrealistic lasting worry about harm coming to the child or caregiver, refusal to go to school or sleep away from the caregiver, fear of being alone, nightmares about separation, bed-wetting, physical complaints, and intense fear or guilt.  SAD may be triggered by stressful or traumatic events, overprotectiveness of parents, insecure attachment to caregivers, or the presence of other anxiety disorders. It is suggested that SAD can be inherited as it often occurs in children with family members having anxiety or other mental disorders. Co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder or depression is also observed.  Diagnosis involves checking the child's medical history, physical examination, and ruling out physical illness or medication side effects through lab tests. If physical illness is ruled out, the child may be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for further evaluation.  Treatment is typically necessary for severe cases or when the child refuses to go to school. The goals of treatment involve reducing anxiety, developing a sense of security in the child and caregivers, and educating about natural separations. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the primary treatment, aiming to help the child handle separation without distress. Family therapy, medication (antidepressants or anti-anxiety), and school interventions may also be used. Parents can support treatment by understanding SAD's effects, ensuring regular therapy appointments, identifying anxiety triggers, and applying therapy techniques at home or school.  While there's no known way to prevent SAD, early recognition and treatment involving the entire family is beneficial.

This balance is particularly critical in your gut, where it aids various functions like immune system regulation, food breakdown, vitamin production, and digestion of complex carbohydrates. However, any disruption to this balance might increase your susceptibility to diseases including Crohns disease.  Crohns disease is linked to the gut microbiome, but this relationship is complex. It involves numerous factors, including your genes, inflammation, and digestion. People with Crohns and ulcerative colitis often have less diverse gut microbiomes, with fewer species that reduce inflammation. It's unclear whether these changes are a cause or a result of the disease. Risk factors for Crohns like stomach flu, smoking, and early antibiotic use can also affect your microbiome.  Diet plays a significant role in maintaining the balance of bacteria in your gut. Fiber-rich foods, such as garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, bananas, seaweed, fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains, can help maintain a healthy gut environment. However, they can also cause bloating and gas, so it's recommended to introduce them gradually to your diet.  Fermented foods like kefir, yogurt with active cultures, pickled vegetables, tempeh, kombucha, kimchi, miso, and sauerkraut can be beneficial as they contain helpful live microbes.

Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: This lasts less than a week and may not need treatment. It could occur due to heavy drinking or extreme stress.  2. Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: This lasts longer than a week and might need medicine or treatment to stop. It's more common in older people, those with high blood pressure, heart diseases, or in former smokers. 3. Long-Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation: This lasts for more than a year and may not go away even with medication or treatment. Doctors might use another treatment like ablation to restore the heart's normal rhythm. 4. Permanent Atrial Fibrillation: If you have this, you might need long-term medication to control your heart rate and lower your chances of having a stroke. 5. Valvular and Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: Both can cause blood to pool in your heart, increasing your risk of blood clots and strokes. Valvular is caused by a heart valve problem, and nonvalvular is caused by other factors like high blood pressure or an overactive thyroid. 6. Acute Onset Atrial Fibrillation: This comes and goes away quickly, usually within 24 to 48 hours. It can be caused by age, heart disease, alcohol abuse, diabetes, or lung disease. 7. Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation: This is a common complication after heart surgery and can increase risk of heart failure and brain injury.  The document emphasizes that if you have symptoms, you should see a doctor to discuss the best treatment for you.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on heart_disease from the perspective of a normal person."}

These extended-use pills include Amethia, Camrese, Simpesse, Jolessa, Seasonale, and Rivelsa, differing slightly in hormonal composition and administration. For instance, Amethia, Camrese, and Simpesse involve 84 days of active pills followed by a week of low-dose estrogen pills. Jolessa and Seasonale follow a similar regimen but with a week of inactive pills instead. Rivelsa has a steady dose of progestin, but the estrogen dose increases gradually over the 84 days, followed by a week of low-dose estrogen.   For most women, delaying menstruation with these extended-use pills can be safe and convenient, especially for those with conditions like endometriosis and anemia which can worsen during periods. However, potential drawbacks may include difficulty in recognizing pregnancy symptoms due to reduced frequency of periods, and possible health risks such as blood clots, high blood pressure, heart attacks, deep vein thrombosis, and strokes, albeit in a small percentage of users. Breakthrough bleeding is a common complaint but usually subsides as the body adapts to the extended cycle.   Smokers are at a higher risk for complications, and regular pill intake is recommended to prevent breakthrough bleeding. The Affordable Care Act has mitigated out-of-pocket costs for most contraception methods, including extended-use pills, but certain brands may still require out-of-pocket payment.

The document also describes flexitarians who occasionally consume meat and fish. As per a 2018 Gallup poll, 5% of Americans identify as vegetarians. The health benefits of vegetarianism are outlined, including reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence linking vegetarianism to lower cancer risk is inconclusive. An 11-year study in Germany observed lower mortality rate due to stomach, colon, and lung cancer in vegetarians, but the researchers suggest other factors like body weight and exercise levels might have influenced these results.   From a nutritional standpoint, vegetarians must ensure adequate intake of vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and zinc. Deficiency of vitamin B12, which is naturally found only in animal products, can lead to anemia, blindness, muscle weakness, and numbness. Vegans and ovo-vegetarians need to supplement the calcium missing from their diets to protect against osteoporosis. Pregnant and lactating women who are vegans need to be cautious of vitamin B12 and D deficiencies, which can impair neurological development in infants and cause bone demineralization in breastfeeding women. Vegan and vegetarian diets for children under 5 can lead to impaired growth due to potential deficiencies in vitamin B12 and D.   The document provides guidelines for incorporating key nutrients in a vegetarian diet. For protein, options include tofu, edamame, tempeh, veggie burgers, beans, legumes, nuts, nut butters, eggs, and high-protein grains like quinoa and amaranth. For iron, options include eggs, fortified cereals, soy-based foods, dried fruits, nuts, beans, legumes, and fortified whole wheat bread. Calcium can be obtained from dairy products, edamame, tofu, almonds, sesame tahini, calcium-fortified juices, non-dairy fortified beverages, and dark leafy greens.

This means your health plan must contribute to your cancer treatment costs and your coverage cannot be cancelled or denied due to cancer. If eligible and interested, you may participate in clinical trials for new cancer treatments, with your health plan covering regular costs.   The Act also sets a maximum limit on the amount you have to pay for medical care from your doctors and hospitals. There's no limit on the amount an insurance company can spend on your health care expenses, and you can't be charged more if you're sick. In 2022, out-of-pocket costs for in-network care are capped at $8,700 per year for singles and $17,400 for families. Financial aid may be available if you're buying insurance through your state's Marketplace and you might qualify for Medicaid.   The Act also emphasizes mental health support during cancer treatment, with most health plans required to provide mental health services under the same conditions as other health services.   For seniors on Medicare Part D, the Act eliminates the \"donut hole\", or gap in prescription drug coverage, reducing your payment to only 25% of the costs of both covered brand name and generic drugs.   Additionally, the Act requires certain essential health benefits to be covered, such as chronic disease care, hospital care, lab services, mental health services, outpatient treatment, and prescription drug coverage. However, details may vary depending on the state and the individual health plan.

Both cause red, itchy, dry, scaly, or cracked skin. Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is chronic and can appear anywhere on the body. It's caused by a genetic mutation that reduces the protein filaggrin, weakening the skin's barrier and making it prone to dryness and sensitivity. Triggers for atopic dermatitis include soaps, detergents, dust, pollen, sweat, stress, and hot showers or baths.  On the other hand, contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction that usually occurs where your skin touched an irritant like soap, perfume, or poison ivy. Triggers are similar to atopic dermatitis but can also include chemicals, bleach, makeup, metals, or certain fabrics.  Atopic dermatitis can flare up sporadically, sometimes with years between episodes, while contact dermatitis reacts quickly after contact with an irritant and clears up after a few weeks.   Your doctor can diagnose either condition with a physical exam and maybe a patch test. Treatment involves avoiding triggers and keeping skin moisturized and cool. Topical creams or ointments could be prescribed, and in severe cases, oral medications may be used. There are also at-home remedies like over-the-counter creams, moisturizers, warm baths with baking soda or oatmeal, wearing comfortable clothes, and protecting your skin from known triggers.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on eczema from the perspective of a patient."}

Dry skin is quite common and can be triggered by things like cold climate, indoor heating, long hot showers, frequent hand washing, and harsh soaps or detergents. Eczema, however, is less common and is often caused by a combination of genetics, a faulty immune response, and environmental triggers like allergens, pollutants, and stress.   If you have eczema, your skin's outer layer may not function properly, leading to dryness. Dry skin doesn't cause eczema, but it can trigger symptom flare-ups in people who are already at risk.   You can tell the difference between the two conditions by looking at your symptoms and your family and medical history. Dry skin tends to be tight, rough, and flaky, while eczema is typically red or grey, bumpy with blisters, and thick.  Simple lifestyle changes like taking shorter showers, moisturizing regularly, using gentle skincare products, and using a humidifier can help treat dry skin and manage eczema symptoms.   For eczema, there are various treatments available, including over-the-counter antihistamines, hydrocortisone, prescription topical medicines, steroid pills, phototherapy, and even medications that work on your immune system to prevent flare-ups.   If your dry skin symptoms don't improve with home treatments or your eczema symptoms don't improve with over-the-counter treatments, it's recommended to see a doctor.

Symptoms include breathlessness, leg swelling, and fluid retention.   The document highlights various complications such as abnormal heart rhythm, heart valve problems, kidney and liver damage, anemia, lung problems, and extreme weight and muscle loss. Abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, can cause a reduction in blood flow, potentially leading to clots and consequent stroke. Heart valve issues arise from overworking the heart, and kidney damage or failure can occur due to insufficient blood supply. This kidney damage can worsen heart failure by causing fluid retention and high blood pressure.   Anemia, resulting from insufficient red blood cells, can starve the body of oxygen. This condition can be exacerbated by kidney damage, which hinders the production of erythropoietin, a protein vital for red blood cell production. Liver damage can also occur due to inadequate blood supply, leading to the inability to effectively detoxify the body and store bile. Lung problems can arise due to blood back up from the failing heart and consequent pressure in the veins, leading to pulmonary edema.

Currently, heart failure cannot be cured, but can be managed with medication, diet, exercise, and sometimes surgery.  There can be complications like abnormal heart rhythm, heart valve problems, kidney and liver damage, lung problems, and extreme weight and muscle loss. Atrial fibrillation is one such abnormal rhythm that may cause your blood to clot, potentially leading to a stroke. Kidney and liver damages are due to lack of blood supply, which may lead to kidney failure and scarred liver. Lung problems occur when a damaged heart can't pump blood out of your lungs effectively, causing difficulty in breathing.  Despite these possible complications, the document encourages that with proper care and treatment, these issues can be managed.

It works by introducing small amounts of radioactive material into your body, allowing doctors to see your organs and tissues, and how they function. This can be helpful in spotting tumors, seeing if cancer has spread, or checking if a treatment is effective.  In terms of diagnosis, doctors use things called radionuclides that release low levels of radiation. You take these orally or through an intravenous drip. They then scan your body to see the areas of activity and can identify tumors, infections, etc. There are different types of scans like bone scans, gallium scans, MUGA scans, PET scans, and thyroid scans, each focusing on different areas and functions of the body. The type of scan you get depends on what the doctors are looking for.  Nuclear medicine can also be used to treat cancer. Some of the treatments include Radioimmunotherapy, which is a treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Radioactive iodine therapy, which is used for thyroid cancer, and Brachytherapy, which involves placing radioactive material inside your body to target and kill cancer cells. These treatments are generally more targeted and cause fewer side effects than conventional radiation therapy. Another form of treatment is Y90 radioembolization, specifically for liver cancer, which involves introducing radiation directly into the liver artery.  The procedure of nuclear medicine scans is not painful and usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour. You may need to stop eating or drinking for a certain amount of time before your scan.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a patient."}

Persistent AFib refers to ongoing symptoms for more than a week, while permanent AFib describes a situation where heart rhythm cannot be restored. Indicators of AFib worsening include frequent episodes, longer-lasting symptoms, or diminished effectiveness of medication.  The document further outlines lifestyle changes recommended for managing AFib symptoms, such as regular physical activity, blood pressure control, a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation, cholesterol management, maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding excess caffeine or alcohol.   AFib medications aim to control symptoms and prevent strokes, but if they become ineffective, adjustments or a change in treatment plan may be required. If medications are insufficient, procedures such as cardioversion (either electrical or with drugs), pacemaker installation, or cardiac ablation (catheter ablation, maze procedure, or AV node ablation) may be considered.   Another treatment option is Left Atrial Appendage Closure, a procedure that closes off the left atrial appendage to prevent blood clots from escaping, thereby reducing stroke risk. Devices such as Watchman, AtriClip, Amplatzer plug, or a LARIAT may be used for this purpose.

Symptoms can vary widely, affecting one or more senses, and can range from being overly reactive (e.g., vomiting at the sound of a leaf blower or recoiling from certain food textures) to under-reactive (e.g., not responding to extreme temperatures or pain). These symptoms can cause significant disruption to everyday life.  Despite not being widely recognized as a distinct medical diagnosis, treatments are available. These often involve occupational therapists and are tailored to the individual's needs. Therapy aims to help the person improve in areas they struggle with and get used to things they find difficult to tolerate. One common type of therapy is sensory integration, which uses fun, playful challenges to help the individual respond more appropriately to sensory stimuli.

The condition impedes the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently, leading to symptoms like weakness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. It also increases the risk of severe health problems, including stroke, kidney disease, and heart failure.   A strong association exists between obesity (a body mass index of 30 or higher) and AFib, with obese individuals being twice as likely to have the condition. In fact, losing at least 10% of body weight can significantly reduce the likelihood of AFib recurrence. Excess fat, especially around the waist, directly impacts the heart, causing electrical and chemical changes and increasing inflammation. Obesity often coexists with other health issues, like hypertension, coronary artery disease, sleep apnea, and diabetes, which are all linked to increased AFib risk.  Treatment for AFib can range from medications that reset the heart's rhythm to surgical procedures, such as cardiac ablation. This procedure involves using radio waves, heat, or extreme cold to destroy the damaged tissue causing AFib. However, the efficacy of this treatment is lower in obese patients, and the odds of AFib recurrence are higher.  The document advocates for weight loss as the primary intervention, which can also help control other health problems like hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

If you have mild ulcerative colitis, you might experience slight cramping pains in your abdomen, a painful urge to move your bowels without being able to go, and periods of constipation. Moderate ulcerative colitis can lead to more frequent bowel movements, bloody stools, mild anemia, and abdominal pain. Severe ulcerative colitis can cause symptoms like frequent loose and bloody stools, severe cramps, weight loss, and severe anemia.   There are four main types of ulcerative colitis, each affecting different parts of your colon and rectum.

To manage eczema, the document advises regular moisturizing and avoiding allergy triggers. Some tips include getting allergy tests, keeping an eczema journal, avoiding skin irritants, maintaining low humidity at home, and using thick creams or ointments. For infants at high risk of allergies, some doctors recommend delaying the introduction of solid foods until they are at least six months old. Also, it is suggested that breastfeeding for the first 6 to 12 months may lower the child's chance of having allergies or asthma later.

These can cause a blockage, preventing food or waste from passing through your intestines easily. Symptoms of a blockage can include nausea, vomiting, bloating, loud stomach sounds, and sharp, cramp-like pains in the stomach.  Mild blockages may be treated with medications, but in severe cases or if the blockage is caused by scar tissue, surgery might be necessary. There are several types of surgery, including small bowel resection and ileocecal resection, which involve removing the blocked part of the intestine. Alternatively, a strictureplasty can be performed to widen the narrowed area without removing any part of the intestine. A subtotal colectomy, or large bowel resection, might be needed if the blockage is in the large intestine.  After surgery, benefits can last a long time. However, about half of the patients may experience a recurrence of blockage within 5 years. In these cases, 50% can be treated with medications, while the other half might need another surgery.  Possible complications of these surgeries include short bowel syndrome, where too much of the intestine is removed and it can no longer nourish the body properly. Another complication is perforation, where a hole is created in the intestinal wall, causing a potentially deadly infection called peritonitis.

Between 18% and 47% of AFib patients also have CAD due to common risk factors such as older age, hypertension, and diabetes, but only 0.2% to 5% of CAD patients have AFib. AFib often presents with no symptoms or with a rapid or pounding heartbeat, fatigue, or shortness of breath. CAD typically develops over time, and symptoms may not appear until significant blockage occurs, manifesting as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue, with the first symptom often being a heart attack.  Risk factors for AFib increase with age, with those over 55 having a 37% risk. CAD, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, obesity, sleep apnea, and emphysema can damage the heart's electrical system leading to AFib.

To feel your best, consider the following steps:  1. Eat Smart: Consuming a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein is beneficial. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, salt, caffeine, and alcohol. If you're on blood thinners, be cautious about consuming too much vitamin K-rich foods like broccoli, spinach, or lettuce.  2. Stay Active: Regular exercise, approved by your doctor, can help control your weight, improve your sleep, and strengthen your heart. However, if you experience irregular heart rhythm during workouts, stop and rest.  3. Control Your Weight: If you're overweight, losing at least 10% of your body weight through diet and exercise can help manage your condition.  4. Quit Smoking: The nicotine in cigarettes can exacerbate AFib and increase your risk for heart diseases. Seek doctor's advice on quitting methods.  5. Manage Stress: High stress levels can trigger AFib episodes. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, exercise, massage, meditation, and yoga. Seek professional help if stress becomes too overwhelming.  6. Get Enough Sleep: Aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. If you have sleep apnea, a condition common in AFib patients, consult your doctor for a diagnosis.  7. Follow Your Treatment Plan: Adhere to your prescribed treatment plan to control your heart rhythm and prevent blood clots.

Both conditions cause red, itchy, inflamed skin rash but are triggered differently.   Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is chronic and can appear at any age, often in early childhood. It's caused by a genetic mutation that makes the skin more porous, dry, and sensitive, leading to rashes. This type of dermatitis can be triggered by substances like soaps, detergents, dust, pollen, sweat, stress, or even long, hot showers.   On the other hand, contact dermatitis is a skin inflammation caused by an allergic reaction to something that touches your skin, like certain chemicals or materials. The rash usually appears on the area of your skin where it touched the irritant. It can be triggered by irritants like detergents, chemicals, bleach, dust, shampoo, makeup, metals like nickel, or allergens like wool or poison ivy.  Both conditions can be diagnosed by a doctor through a physical exam and possibly a patch test. Treatment usually involves avoiding the triggers, keeping the skin moisturized and cool, and not scratching the skin too much. Doctors may also prescribe creams or oral medications. At home, over-the-counter creams and lotions can be used for relief, as well as lukewarm baths with baking soda or colloidal oatmeal.

The diaphragm, a silicone cup inserted into the vagina, has a 6% failure rate when used correctly with spermicide. The cervical cap, placed over the cervix, fails about 20% of the time. The contraceptive sponge prevents pregnancy 91% of the time for women who have never given birth and use it correctly.  2. Copper IUD: A T-shaped plastic device inserted into the uterus, this method is over 99% effective at preventing conception and can be left in for 10 years.  3. Spermicide: Used in the vagina to kill or paralyze sperm, it has a failure rate of about 28%.  4. Vaginal Gel: This method, which maintains vaginal pH to prevent sperm mobility, is considered 86% effective.  5. Condoms: They're about 82% effective at preventing pregnancy and the only method that protects against STDs.  6. Surgical Methods: Sterilization surgeries like tubal ligation and vasectomy are almost 100% effective but are permanent.  7. Behavioral Methods: The outercourse and pull-out methods are simple, free, and carry a low risk of STDs but are not very reliable.  8. Natural Family Planning: This involves tracking the menstrual cycle to identify fertile days. It has no side effects but a high failure rate (up to 23%).

These diseases are all caused by viruses and can cause serious health problems. Measles can start with fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash that spreads all over the body, potentially leading to pneumonia, brain inflammation, seizures, and brain damage. Mumps often causes swelling in the glands below the ears, and can also lead to meningitis, deafness, and in men, infertility. Rubella, also known as German measles, can cause a mild rash, swollen glands, joint swelling, and fever. It's particularly dangerous for pregnant women as it can lead to birth defects in their children.  The MMR vaccine is given in two shots, usually in early childhood. If you're unsure whether you've had the diseases or the vaccines, it's possible to get the vaccine as an adult. However, people with severe allergies to the vaccine components, those who may be pregnant or are planning to, or those with weak immune systems due to certain conditions like cancer or AIDS should not get the shot.  Most people don't experience side effects from the MMR vaccine, but some may experience fever, minor soreness, redness, rash, swollen glands, seizures, joint pain, low platelet count or bleeding, and encephalitis.

Two methods are discussed to manage the disease: the step-up and top-down methods.   The step-up method starts with milder drugs, gradually adding stronger ones if symptoms worsen. This approach is beneficial because it avoids over-treatment by only administering the minimum medication needed for relief. However, the drawbacks include potential failure to repair intestinal damage caused by Crohn's and potentially serious complications if the disease worsens.  On the other hand, the top-down method begins with the most potent drugs in hopes of halting the disease early on. This method could lead to remission faster, fewer flare-ups, and may potentially repair damage caused by Crohn's. However, the downside is the risk of taking stronger medicine than needed and the higher cost of these drugs, which might not be covered by insurance.  Both methods use a range of medicines, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. These drugs can have varied side effects, including increased susceptibility to infections, acne, high blood pressure, insomnia, and increased risk of certain cancers.

The procedure can be performed in a hospital or an outpatient surgical clinic and involves the use of anesthesia. The surgeon makes one or two small incisions in the abdomen, inflates it with gas for better visibility, and then employs a long, thin device to cut, seal, band, clamp, or tie the fallopian tubes shut. Following the procedure, the patient can usually go home within a few hours.  While it is highly effective, tubal ligation does not guarantee 100% prevention of pregnancy. There is a 0.5% failure rate, usually if the tubes regrow and reconnect, which is extremely rare. Post-procedure recovery may involve abdominal and shoulder pain, fatigue, dizziness, and bloating. Normal activities, including sex and heavy lifting, can typically be resumed within a few days to a few weeks.  The procedure carries certain risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to other organs or major blood vessels, side effects due to anesthesia, and ectopic pregnancy. Patients with prior abdominal surgery, obesity, diabetes, pelvic inflammatory disease, or lung disease are potentially at higher risk of complications.   The cost of a tubal ligation can range from $1,500 to $6,000, typically covered by insurance. While reversal of tubal ligation is possible in some cases, it is a major surgery with a success rate dependent on the method of tubal ligation used, how long ago it was performed, and the extent of damage to the tubes.

This can cause them to refuse to go to school or sleep away from home, and they may experience physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches. It's normal for young children to experience some separation anxiety, but if it's severe or lasts for more than 4 weeks in a child over 6 years old, it might be SAD. This condition affects around 4%-5% of children in the U.S. aged 7 to 11 and is less common in teenagers.  Causes could include traumatic events, overprotective parents, or having family members with anxiety or other mental disorders. Children with SAD might also have other anxiety disorders or depression. To diagnose SAD, a doctor will look for signs and symptoms, ask about medical history, and may use tests to rule out physical illness or medication side effects. If no physical illness is found, the child may be referred to a mental health professional.  Treatment is not usually needed for mild cases. For severe cases, cognitive behavioral therapy (talking therapy) is the main treatment, which helps the child to handle being separated from their caregiver without causing distress. Family therapy can also be helpful. In some cases, medication or school intervention may be used. Parents can help by understanding the child's condition, finding out what triggers their anxiety, and helping them manage their feelings at home or in school.

If your doctor isn't sure whether you have Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, you might get an ANCA test. Up to 80% of people with ulcerative colitis test positive for a specific type of ANCA. The ANCA test can also help predict if you'll respond well to certain IBD medicines.  This test is also commonly used to diagnose vasculitis, a group of autoimmune disorders that affect small blood vessels. Vasculitis symptoms vary depending on which blood vessels are affected, and the ANCA test can help diagnose it if you have symptoms like fever, fatigue, weight loss, muscle or joint aches, vision or hearing loss, skin rashes or sores, or abnormalities in your urine.  The ANCA test involves drawing a blood sample. It's a straightforward procedure and doesn't require special preparation. After the test, you might have a small bruise where the blood was taken. The results usually take a few days. If the test is positive, it could mean you have an autoimmune vasculitis or, if you're showing symptoms of IBD, you're more likely to have ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease. Your doctor will explain your results and discuss the next steps, which might include further tests or treatments.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on ulcerative_colitis from the perspective of a patient."}

Around 10% of IBD patients experience eye problems.   Episcleritis, an inflammation of the outer coating of the eye, is noted as the most common ocular complication linked to IBD. Its severity is directly proportional to the inflammation in the gut. Treatment usually involves managing UC inflammation, with additional treatments including eye drops and topical vasoconstrictors.  Scleritis, affecting the white part of the eye, is another complication that can present with pain, redness, swelling, blurry vision, and light sensitivity. If left untreated, it could lead to vision loss. Treatment options include steroid pills or eye drops, NSAID drugs, eye solutions, antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, and potentially surgery. The severity of scleritis does not correlate with the severity of the underlying IBD.  Uveitis, inflammation of the eye's middle layer, is one of the most serious eye complications related to IBD. Symptoms can be gradual or sudden and include pain, blurry vision, light sensitivity, and eye redness. Without treatment, it can lead to permanent vision damage. Treatment includes steroid eye drops, dilation drops, and possibly pills or injections. Like scleritis, its severity is not related to how severe the IBD is.  Keratopathy, a problem with the cornea, is a rare complication of IBD. It often results in dry eye and can usually be managed with lubricants and artificial tears.   Certain UC medications can cause eye complications. In some cases, it may be necessary to adjust the medication dose or switch to a different drug. Steroids can lead to cataracts and glaucoma, while certain biologic drugs can cause retinopathies.   The document concludes by stressing the importance of regular eye exams for IBD patients, as many common eye diseases present no early symptoms. Early detection and treatment of eye complications linked to UC can prevent permanent vision loss.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on ulcerative_colitis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Aging of the skin is influenced by lifestyle, diet, heredity, and personal habits like smoking, which can lead to premature wrinkles through the production of free radicals. Aging process results in skin becoming rougher, developing benign lesions, losing elasticity leading to slackness, becoming more transparent due to epidermal thinning, and becoming more fragile and easily bruised due to changes in the dermis-epidermis interface and thinning of blood vessel walls.   Subcutaneous changes such as fat loss in facial areas, bone loss around mouth and chin after age 60, and cartilage loss in the nose are also significant. These changes may result in a leaner look, loosening skin, sunken eyes, puckering of skin around the mouth, and accentuation of bony structures in the nose.   Sun exposure is the primary environmental factor contributing to skin aging, damaging elastin fibers leading to skin sagging, stretching, bruising, and delayed healing. While skin has some capacity to repair sun damage, sun protection methods like sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, clothing to cover exposed skin, and sunglasses are recommended.  Secondary factors like gravity, facial movement, and sleep position also contribute to skin changes. Loss of skin elasticity due to these factors can lead to visible facial movement lines and sleep creases.   Skin dryness and itching are common in older people, with 85% experiencing \"winter itch\" due to dry, overheated indoor air and loss of oil glands with age. If severe, this condition should be evaluated by a doctor as it can impact sleep, cause irritability, or indicate underlying disease.

However, these medicines can have side effects like liver damage, stomach problems, and increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially when taken in large doses or combined with alcohol.  For more severe pain, your doctor may prescribe opioids. These are stronger pain relievers, but they can cause side effects like constipation, drowsiness, and upset stomach. If you experience these side effects, your doctor can adjust your dosage or prescribe additional medication to manage them.  Other prescription medications can also be used, including anti-seizure medicines and antidepressants for nerve pain and steroids for inflammation. In some states, medical marijuana is also an option for pain management.  These medications can be administered in various forms, such as pills, capsules, suppositories, injections, skin patches, or intravenously (IV). There's also a method called patient-controlled analgesia, which allows you to control your medication dosage by pressing a button.

Your body needs some cholesterol to function, but too much can increase your risk of heart disease.  There are several factors that can lead to high cholesterol. Some, like age, gender, and family history, are out of your control. For example, risk increases as you age and if you have a family history of high cholesterol or early heart disease. Women's LDL (bad) cholesterol levels tend to rise after menopause, increasing their risk too.  However, there are factors within your control. Your diet, for example, plays a big role - foods high in trans fats, saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels. Being overweight can also raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL (good) cholesterol. Lack of physical activity can have similar effects.  Smoking damages your blood vessels, making it easier for fatty deposits to build up, and lowers your good cholesterol levels. Type 2 diabetes can also worsen your cholesterol profile, lowering good cholesterol and raising another type of cholesterol called triglycerides. High blood pressure often goes hand-in-hand with high cholesterol, as they share similar risk factors like lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, and obesity.  The good news is that by making changes like eating a healthier diet, exercising more, losing weight, and quitting smoking, you can control your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of heart disease.

They can form in various places, including the intestines, bladder, or straight through the bowel wall to your skin surface. Fistulas are common in Crohn's disease, with up to half of all adults with this condition developing a fistula.   There are several types of fistulas, each with their own symptoms. An anal fistula might cause a painful bump or boil around your butt, while a bowel-to-bladder fistula could lead to frequent urinary tract infections. Bowel-to-vagina fistulas might result in passing gas or poop through your vagina. Bowel-to-skin fistulas, often occuring on your stomach, can cause your skin to become red and sore, while bowel-to-bowel fistulas can lead to diarrhea and malnutrition.  Fistulas are diagnosed through physical exams and imaging tests like CT scans, ultrasounds, and MRIs. Treatments vary depending on the complexity of the fistula. Simple anal fistulas might be treated with antibiotics and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents like infliximab. More complex fistulas could require surgery. Surgical options include inserting a thin surgical cord to help drain infection, using a medical plug, cutting open the fistula, or injecting medical glue. In some cases, you might need an ileostomy while your body heals from surgery.  After a fistula is treated, you will be closely monitored to ensure it doesn't return and new ones do not develop. You can help prevent fistulas by keeping your Crohn's disease under control.

The ultimate goal of treatment is to achieve remission, which is a period when the disease is no longer active, inflammation stops, and the patient feels normal and healthy.   Remission is not a cure as most people with Crohn's go through cycles of remission and relapses. There are different types of remission such as clinical (no symptoms), endoscopic (no signs of disease when checked with an endoscope), histologic (cells from the colon look normal under a microscope), surgical (lack of disease activity after surgery), and biochemical (no signs of inflammation in blood or stool).   Treatment, which often involves medications or sometimes surgery, is typically required to achieve remission as the condition usually doesn't improve on its own. Medications aim to reduce inflammation, ease symptoms, and help intestines heal. Sometimes, parts of the intestines are surgically removed to control the disease.  While in remission, the patient should adhere to their treatment plan, avoid trigger foods and drinks, and maintain a healthy diet to prevent relapses. It's also recommended to avoid smoking, certain drugs like NSAIDs and antibiotics (unless prescribed by the doctor), and to keep up with regular doctor's appointments and vaccinations.   Relapses are more common in women and those diagnosed before age 25.

Remission implies little or no evident cancer in the body, as confirmed by X-rays, MRI scans, or blood tests, and often results in eased symptoms. Patients may reduce or cease their treatments but require regular check-ups to ensure cancer doesn't return. The document outlines two types of remission: partial, where treatments have eliminated most cancer cells but some persist, and the tumor size has been significantly reduced or stabilized; and complete, where all symptoms and signs of cancer have disappeared.   A patient's remission is typically determined via tests for cancer cells in the blood, or scans to check for tumor size reduction or disappearance post-surgery. A period of one month without tumor growth post-treatment is needed to qualify as remission. However, complete remission doesn't guarantee permanent eradication of cancer, necessitating regular check-ups for potential disease recurrence, which can occur unpredictably.  The path to remission is contingent on factors such as cancer type, stage, treatment side effects, patient's age, and overall health. Aggressive treatment may be chosen for early-stage cancers, while partial remission may be preferred to minimize side effects. Treatments that can induce remission encompass chemotherapy, targeted therapies, radiation, surgery, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and bone marrow or stem cell therapy. Often, a combination of treatments is needed.  Maintenance therapy, involving lower doses of cancer drugs or hormones, can help sustain remission.

Symptoms of bowel obstructions range from nausea, bloating, loud stomach sounds, to cramp-like stomach pains. The treatment approach depends on the severity of the obstruction; medication may be sufficient for mild cases, but surgical intervention may be required for severe or recurrent obstructions.   There are several types of surgeries for bowel obstruction: Small bowel resection, which involves the removal of the blocked or damaged part of the small intestine; Ileocecal resection, where the blocked terminal ileum is removed and the healthy ends are joined; Strictureplasty, which widens the stricture without removing any of the intestine; and Subtotal colectomy, also known as large bowel resection, removes the blocked part of the large intestine.   These surgeries can be performed laparoscopically or through open surgery, depending on the extent of the damage. Laparoscopic procedures involve smaller incisions and the use of a laparoscope, while open surgery involves larger incisions.   Post-surgery, approximately half of Crohn's patients may have a blockage recurrence within 5 years. However, in 50% of these cases, medication can be used instead of further surgery. Complications from these surgeries can include short bowel syndrome and perforation, leading to potentially dangerous conditions such as peritonitis.

It is a significant cause of bacterial meningitis in children aged 2 to 18 in the U.S. This disease can result in serious complications, including loss of limbs, hearing loss, nervous system problems, intellectual disability, seizures, and strokes. Fortunately, the disease is preventable with a meningococcal vaccine.  The disease is not highly contagious, but it can be spread via contact with infected respiratory and throat secretions, like through coughing, kissing, or sneezing. Family members, caregivers, and college students living in dormitories are at elevated risk due to their close contact with potentially infected individuals.  There are several types of meningococcal vaccines available in the U.S. These vaccines work by encouraging the body's immune system to create antibodies that can attack and kill the bacteria. The vaccines do not contain live bacteria and cannot cause the disease.  The vaccines are generally effective, preventing the disease about 85-90% of the time. However, they do not protect against all strains of the bacterium, so it's still possible to contract meningitis after vaccination. Other vaccines, like the Hib vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine, can also help protect against other causes of meningitis.  The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for children aged 11 or 12, with a booster at ages 16 to 18. Certain groups, like college freshmen living in dorms, military recruits, people with certain medical conditions, and people traveling to countries where the disease is common, are also recommended to receive the vaccine.  Some mild side effects are common with the vaccine, like redness or pain at the injection site, or a mild fever. Severe side effects are very rare. There have been some concerns about a potential link between the vaccine and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but current data suggests that there is no higher risk for people receiving the vaccine than for the general population. The benefits of the vaccine significantly outweigh the potential risks.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on children_s_health from the perspective of a normal person."}

Condoms, both external (male) and internal (female), act as a reliable form of contraceptive and prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The materials used to manufacture condoms include latex, plastic, lambskin, and nitrile. Latex and nitrile condoms are the most effective against STIs and HIV, while plastic and lambskin condoms are less reliable.  The document also warns of the risk of condom breakage, which can lead to potential infection or unwanted pregnancy. Signs of a broken condom include a tear in the condom, semen leakage, or a missing condom following intercourse. In such scenarios, it suggests methods such as expelling semen, avoiding douching, and avoiding oral hygiene practices immediately following oral sex to prevent micro-tears. It also advises seeking immediate medical consultation and STI testing, and considering post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV within 72 hours if at high risk. For pregnancy prevention, it recommends taking an emergency contraceptive pill, which is most effective when taken as soon as possible post-intercourse.  The document identifies various causes of condom breakage, including incorrect usage or size, use of oil-based lubricants with latex condoms, using expired or poorly stored condoms, \"double-bagging\" or using two condoms at once, and trapping air inside the condom. Preventive measures include checking the condom's expiration date, carefully opening the wrapper, using the appropriate lubricant, wearing the correct size, and proper storage.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on birth_control from the perspective of a doctor."}

Research suggests that nicotine may have protective effects against UC due to its potential anti-inflammatory properties. It is hypothesized that nicotine or other substances in tobacco decrease the levels of cytokines, activate immune cells to reduce inflammation, produce carbon monoxide (a potential anti-inflammatory agent), and generate more mucus to support gut bacteria health. Studies indicate that UC patients who smoke are less likely to experience a relapse, require hospitalization or stronger medication, or need bowel removal surgery.   However, the use of nicotine as a treatment for UC has not been definitively established due to ethical constraints on research. A few treatment options such as nicotine gum, patches, or enemas have been explored, but they come with potential side effects including pancreatitis, nausea, and headaches. It's also worth noting that some studies found nicotine enemas ineffective for active UC.  The document further explains that while smoking may have a protective effect against UC, it damages the gastrointestinal tract in other ways and can increase the risk of other inflammatory diseases. It also negatively impacts Crohn's disease, another type of inflammatory bowel disease, by increasing the likelihood of complications, frequent hospitalizations, surgical interventions, and poor medication response.  Despite these potential benefits for UC, the document strongly advises against using cigarettes or vaping methods to manage UC symptoms due to the overall detrimental health effects of smoking. For UC patients interested in possible benefits of nicotine, they should consult their doctor about safer nicotine options like patches or gum. However, these options may not be suitable for everyone as they can lead to addiction.

In mild cases, patients typically experience less than four bowel movements a day, no systemic toxicity, and normal C-reactive protein (CRP) or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). Symptoms may include slight abdominal cramping, an urge to move bowels, and periods of constipation. Moderate ulcerative colitis is characterized by more frequent bowel movements, minimal or no systemic toxicity, and the ability to retain nutrition; symptoms may include bloody stools, mild anemia, and abdominal pain. Severe ulcerative colitis presents with frequent loose and bloody stools, systemic toxicity, tachycardia, severe anemia, elevated CRP or ESR, severe cramps, and weight loss.  The type of ulcerative colitis is determined by the extent of spread and body parts involved. The four main types are Ulcerative Proctitis, Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis, Left-sided colitis, and Extensive colitis, or Pancolitis. These types are diagnosed via colonoscopy and biopsy, and are associated with differing degrees of severity and symptoms.  There is no cure for ulcerative colitis, but treatments aim to reduce symptoms, inflammation, and manage underlying conditions, with the goal of achieving and maintaining remission. Treatments include aminosalicylates for mild to moderate cases; corticosteroids for severe cases, though these are typically short-term due to serious side effects; Biologics for moderate to severe cases, which target parts of the immune system to ease symptoms; and Janus Kinase inhibitors, which inhibit an enzyme triggering inflammation.

This behavior is normal in early childhood development, often occurring between ages 1 and 3, with various reasons such as teething, exploration, seeking attention, and expressing frustration. However, it's important to discourage this behavior.  The document suggests several measures to prevent biting. For teething babies, always having a cool teething ring or washcloth on hand can be beneficial. Also, ensuring your child's needs are met before heading out to play can prevent them from becoming irritable and resorting to biting. As your child grows older, encourage the use of words to express frustration, and give them plenty of attention throughout the day.   If your child does bite, the document advises to firmly tell them that the behavior is unacceptable, explain that it hurts others, and then remove them from the situation until they calm down. It discourages biting or hitting back as a form of discipline, as children learn by imitation.   If biting becomes a frequent issue or continues past age 4 or 5, it might be a sign of a more serious emotional problem, and you may need to seek professional help like a child psychologist or therapist.   Lastly, if a biting injury occurs, it's important to wash the area with soap and water.

High cholesterol leads to the build-up of fatty plaques in arteries, which can lead to these conditions. There are different types of cholesterol: Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) or bad cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) or good cholesterol, and Triglycerides.   High LDL levels can lead to arterial blockage, leading to stroke and heart problems. Lower levels of HDL can also contribute to heart disease. Triglycerides, though not a type of cholesterol, are fats from food that circulate in the body and their levels are measured alongside HDL and LDL to assess the risk of atherosclerosis.   High cholesterol primarily increases the risk of coronary heart disease, can cause a stroke by narrowing arteries that lead to the brain, and can result in peripheral vascular disease by affecting the legs and other areas outside of the heart and brain.   In individuals with diabetes, the balance between HDL and LDL may be upset, with LDL particles sticking to arteries and damaging blood vessel walls more easily. This can lead to a condition called diabetic dyslipidemia. High cholesterol is also linked to high blood pressure or hypertension and can cause erectile dysfunction by narrowing the smaller blood vessels of the penis.

Symptoms may include persistent diarrhea, belly pain and cramps, blood in stool, frequent bowel movements, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. These symptoms can vary over time and may range from mild to severe.  The severity of the disease can be classified as clinical remission (where you experience no major discomfort), mild to moderate, severe (with six or more bloody stools a day, faster heart rate or fever), and toxic (a critical form where you need to go to the hospital).  Complications may include an intestinal hole or tear due to inflammation, which needs immediate surgery. A rare complication is toxic megacolon where your colon can swell and stop working, potentially needing surgery. Heavy bleeding may require a blood transfusion.  Living with ulcerative colitis can be challenging. To cope, share your health issues with those close to you so they can understand your needs. Plan ahead to manage social situations, know where bathrooms are if you're out, and choose food that won't worsen your symptoms. Daily rest, preparing for your days in advance, regular exercise, meditative activities, and scheduling enjoyable activities can help manage stress.

It is noted that 80% of lung cancer fatalities are linked to tobacco usage. Toxins and chemicals from cigarette smoke can instigate varying types of cancers in different parts of the body. The U.S. Surgeon General has explicitly identified smoking as a causal factor for 12 specific cancers, including lung, trachea, bronchus, oropharynx, esophagus, larynx, colorectal, liver, stomach, bladder, myeloid leukemia, pancreas, kidney, ureter, and uterine cervix.  Additionally, the document highlights that tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, including known carcinogens like arsenic, polonium-20, and mercury. These carcinogens can lead to DNA damage, causing abnormal cell growth and proliferation, potentially leading to cancer. It further points out that the toxic substances from smoking can compromise the body's immune response, making it more challenging to fight off cancer.  The document also discusses the risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure and smokeless tobacco products, emphasizing there's no safe way to use tobacco. Even brief exposure can increase cancer risk.  On a positive note, the document enumerates the benefits of smoking cessation, stating that the risk of cancer decreases with reduced smoking and increased time since quitting. For instance, within five years of quitting, the odds for oral, throat, esophageal, and bladder cancer decreases by half.

Regular testing should begin at age 20, and those over 45 (men) or 50 (women), individuals with cholesterol levels higher than 200, low HDL cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, or other high cholesterol risk factors, should consider more frequent testing.   Test preparation includes a fasting period of nine hours before the test and avoiding certain medications that could affect the results. The American Heart Association recommends getting the test done at the doctor's office or a hospital to ensure accuracy and personalized follow-up care.  The test results, commonly referred to as a lipid panel, include total cholesterol, LDL bad cholesterol, HDL good cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Interpretation of these levels is important for assessing cardiovascular risk. For total cholesterol, less than 200 mg/dL is a healthy level, 200-239 mg/dL is borderline, and 240 mg/dL or more is considered high. LDL cholesterol levels should ideally be less than 100 mg/dL, while levels of 160 mg/dL or above are high. HDL cholesterol levels should be at least 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women, with higher levels being better. Triglyceride levels should be less than 150 mg/dL, with levels of 200 mg/dL or higher being high.

The document also suggests an increased cancer risk in the small intestine and colon for patients with long-standing Crohn's disease, although data remains inconclusive. Further non-intestinal complications are diverse, affecting the skin, joints, spine, eyes, liver, bones, and bile ducts. Skin complications include painful, red, raised spots on the legs and a skin ulcerating condition called pyoderma gangrenosum. Eye conditions can lead to visual difficulties, while arthritis can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints.   Spinal inflammation can cause back pain and stiffness, and liver or bile duct inflammation may also occur. Sclerosing cholangitis, a condition causing narrowing and obstruction of liver-draining ducts, can lead to jaundice, recurrent bacterial infections, and liver cirrhosis eventually leading to liver failure. This condition often necessitates a liver transplant and carries an increased risk of bile ducts or gallbladder cancer, especially in patients with cirrhosis.   The document concludes by discussing the nutritional deficiencies in Crohn's disease, which can compromise a child's growth and weaken bones, leading to osteoporosis.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on crohn_s_disease from the perspective of a doctor."}

Despite some anecdotal evidence suggesting specific foods might exacerbate eczema symptoms, there is no scientific proof that food triggers eczema or symptom flare-ups in adults. The practice of elimination diets, where certain foods like eggs or cow's milk are completely cut out, may not be beneficial for adults with eczema unless they have a known food allergy.  However, food allergies in young children can sometimes cause eczema-like symptoms, though after the age of 3 or 4, this is rare. It is advised to consult a doctor if a food allergy is suspected in contributing to a child's skin condition.  Current research is exploring potential benefits of probiotics, tea, and omega-3 fatty acids in managing eczema. Some studies suggest probiotics may help alleviate symptoms in children, and certain teas may provide some relief. Omega-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, are also being investigated for potential benefits.  Despite uncertainties regarding the impact of diet on eczema, a well-balanced eating plan with plenty of fruits, vegetables, non-dairy foods, and whole grains is advised for overall health. Before making significant dietary changes, it's recommended to consult with a doctor.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on eczema from the perspective of a doctor."}

The number of new cancer cases in the U.S. has been slowly decreasing over the past decade, but about 1.9 million people are still expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2022. Cancer can occur at any age, but it's mostly found in middle-aged people and beyond. The types of cancer most commonly found can vary with age, with cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and brain cancer more common in children, while adults over 50 are more likely to get cancers like melanoma, breast, lung, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. Some cancers are harder to detect until later stages. You can lower your risk for cancer by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which includes eating a healthy diet, avoiding smoking, staying out of the sun, and staying active.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on cancer from the perspective of a normal person."}

These medications can cause mild side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea, stomach cramps, muscle soreness, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, sleep problems, rash, or flushed skin. More severe side effects, although rare, may include muscle damage, liver damage, dark-colored urine, urinary tract infections, increased blood sugar or type 2 diabetes, and memory loss or confusion. It is unclear why these severe side effects occur and the most commonly reported issue is muscle pain. Management strategies for these side effects can include: taking a short break from the medication, reviewing other medications that could be contributing to side effects, reducing the dosage, switching treatments, or considering over-the-counter treatments such as CoQ10 supplements or L-carnitine. However, any changes in medication or addition of supplements should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

The cause remains unknown but it is more prevalent in adults aged 20-40, with a higher incidence in women. It is associated with allergies such as hay fever, family history of dyshidrotic eczema, or other eczema forms. Triggers can include stress, contact with certain metals, humid weather, HIV infection, certain immune system treatments, and seasonal allergies.   Symptoms include itching or burning sensation before the blisters appear, red, cracked skin, sweaty skin around the blisters, and nail thickening or discoloration. The blisters usually resolve in 2 to 3 weeks but the underlying skin may remain tender. It can lead to difficulty in performing daily activities if it affects the feet or hands severely. Infected blisters may exhibit pain, swelling, crusting, and pus.   Diagnosis is usually clinical, by a dermatologist, and may be aided by patch tests for metal allergies. No lab test can confirm dyshidrotic eczema. Treatment includes steroid ointments or creams, wet compresses, oral steroids for severe cases, antihistamines, and cool compresses. Other treatments include light therapy, botulinum toxin injections, immunosuppressive medications, or draining the blisters by a dermatologist.   Home care measures include daily washing of hands and feet with mild soap, removing rings before washing hands, wearing cotton-lined gloves when hands are in water, using thick moisturizers, using a humidifier, avoiding allergy triggers, and not scratching the blisters. For individuals sensitive to nickel or cobalt, dietary restrictions may be advised.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on eczema from the perspective of a doctor."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/eczema_hormones_link", "category": "eczema", "perspective": "patient", "summary": "patient : Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a complicated skin condition with many triggers but no definitive cause. It could be a combination of factors like genes, environmental influences, and the way your immune system interacts with hormonal changes.   Eczema tends to run in families and often starts during infancy or early childhood. Hormones, be it due to your sex or emotional state like stress or depression, could contribute to the sudden appearance or reappearance of eczema symptoms. For instance, hormonal changes could lead to dryness in your skin causing intense itching and potentially leading to eczema.   Interestingly, eczema is found to disappear before adolescence in about three-fourths of people diagnosed in childhood. However, if you're one of the remaining one-fourth, you might experience it throughout your adult life or have a recurrence later in life. Sex hormones play a significant role in this, especially for females.   Around puberty, slightly more boys are diagnosed with eczema than girls, but this changes after puberty. Female hormones like estrogen and progesterone can trigger eczema symptoms, while male hormones like testosterone suppress the reaction, reducing inflammation and other eczema signs. This shift could be why more girls have eczema than boys after puberty.  Moreover, hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle or pregnancy can trigger or worsen eczema symptoms. Stress hormones could also lead to eczema flare-ups. Notably, more than 30% of people with eczema have been diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety, indicating a strong link between eczema and mental health.   Lifestyle changes including regular exercise, joining support groups, and practicing relaxation techniques can help manage stress and potentially reduce eczema breakouts. For additional support and resources, the National Eczema Association is a helpful place to start.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on eczema from the perspective of a patient."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/complications-eczema", "category": "eczema", "perspective": "doctor", "summary": "doctor : The document discusses the medical condition Eczema, a broad term for skin conditions that cause itching and redness, affecting over 31 million Americans. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type, with complications largely related to itching which can damage the skin and increase the risk of infections.   Bacterial infections can occur, identified by symptoms like fever, oozing, swelling, soreness, and yellow crust or spots within the eczema. Antibiotics are typically prescribed in such cases.   Cellulitis, a deep skin bacterial infection, is characterized by fever, redness, swelling, and warm, tender skin. Serious cases may require hospitalization for IV medication.   Viral infections such as Eczema herpeticum and Molluscum contagiosum can also occur. Eczema herpeticum is caused by the same viruses that cause cold sores or genital herpes and is treated with antiviral drugs. Molluscum contagiosum creates white or flesh-colored lesions that may itch and swell.  Neurodermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus, a result of the itch-scratch cycle, leads to thick, dry, and leathery skin in the frequently scratched areas. Treatment aims to heal the skin and stop this cycle, with options like steroids, numbing patches, and wraps.   Eczema can also lead to scarring, particularly in healed, previously infected areas. Visible scars may be treated with ointments or surgical procedures.   Seborrheic dermatitis, another type of eczema, mainly affects the scalp and can cause dandruff or hair loss. It is often treated with antifungal creams or medicated shampoo.   Eczema can also lead to sleep problems due to the itching and possibly mental health issues like depression and anxiety due to the chronic nature of the disease. These can be managed with antihistamines, melatonin supplements, regular exercise, and support groups.   The document recommends prevention strategies such as hand hygiene before applying creams, avoiding sharing personal items, and keeping away from persons with cold sores to minimize infection risks.

It can cause symptoms such as upset stomach, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, usually resolving on its own within a week. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required.   Salmonella is usually spread through contaminated foods like raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized dairy products, raw fruits or vegetables, and processed foods. It can also spread through poor hand hygiene and contact with pets carrying the bacteria.   Certain people, such as children under 5, older adults, and those with weak immune systems, are more susceptible to salmonella infection. Risk factors include international travel, taking certain drugs, and having inflammatory bowel disease.   Symptoms typically appear 8 to 72 hours after infection and may include stomach cramps, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. If symptoms persist for more than a week or become severe, it's important to see a doctor. In rare cases, complications like dehydration or joint pain may occur, and the infection can spread to other parts of the body.  Doctors usually diagnose salmonella through blood tests or stool samples. Treatment often involves staying hydrated and in some cases taking antibiotics.   Prevention measures include proper food handling and cooking, frequent hand washing, and avoiding raw or undercooked foods.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on food_and_recipes from the perspective of a patient."}
