In RA, your immune system attacks your joints, causing inflammation that can wear down bone and cartilage, and stretch out tissues that keep the joint in place. This can lead to unstable joints with bones that do not align properly.   Early in the disease, RA tends to attack the small joints of your hands and feet, leading to several types of deformities such as ulnar drift, boutonniere deformity, swan-neck deformity, hitchhiker's thumb, bunion, and claw toe.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and stop the disease from damaging your joints.

Lyme disease, contracted from infected tick bites, can lead to arthritis in about 60% of untreated cases, most commonly affecting the knees. \"Lyme arthritis\" is usually treatable with antibiotics, but in 10% of cases, arthritis persists despite treatment.   The document also covers Psoriatic Arthritis, an autoimmune disorder associated with psoriasis. Like RA, it can cause joint stiffness, pain, and swelling, but it often also results in skin or nail psoriasis, swollen fingers and toes, lower back pain, and foot pain.  Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome, another autoimmune disease, targets the exocrine glands leading to dryness in various body parts, joint inflammation, and a variety of other symptoms including irritated eyes, thick saliva, mouth sores, yeast infections in the mouth and vaginal dryness. It can occur as a standalone disease or as a complication of RA or other autoimmune diseases like lupus, scleroderma, or myositis.  Gout, caused by uric acid buildup in the joints, can mimic RA in its later stages. It often starts with severe pain and swelling in one area, commonly the big toe, and can be triggered by kidney disease, certain medications, alcohol, or foods high in purines.   Fibromyalgia, a chronic disorder causing pain, stiffness, and fatigue, can also present symptoms similar to RA. However, unlike RA, fibromyalgia does not cause visible joint damage and is characterized by widespread pain, rather than pain confined to affected areas.  Lastly, Lupus, an autoimmune disease more common in women, can cause symptoms similar to RA but tends to cause more widespread inflammation in the body, potentially affecting the skin, blood cells, kidneys, brain, heart, and lungs. The joint symptoms from lupus are typically less disabling than those from RA, and lupus almost never leads to bone destruction.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Patients with Lupus often experience various skin problems that can be managed with topical medications like steroid creams or gels, and sometimes steroid shots. Sunscreen is recommended as a preventative measure against the sun's ultraviolet rays.  Skin Lupus can occur with or without systemic lupus erythematosus. It manifests in various rashes including the 'butterfly' or 'malar' rash, which spreads over the nose and cheeks and is often triggered by UV exposure. Other symptoms include coin-shaped sores and rashes, red, scaly patches, or a ring-shaped rash in areas exposed to the sun. These sores can lead to scarring and even permanent baldness if they occur on the scalp. Subacute cutaneous lesions are small, red, coin-shaped areas caused by sun exposure, resembling patches of psoriasis.  Lupus may also cause skin problems in the mouth, scalp, lower legs, and fingers. These include mucous membrane lesions (sores in the mouth or nose), hair loss due to immune system attacking hair follicles, and purplish spots on lower legs (cutaneous vasculitis lesions) indicating inflamed and damaged blood vessels. These lesions can cause severe skin tissue damage and gangrene.  Blood vessel constriction in fingers and toes (Raynaud's phenomenon) can cause color changes and sensations of pain or numbness. Livedo reticularis is another skin condition associated with Lupus, giving a bluish, lacy pattern under the skin, often on the legs.

High levels may indicate RA, but it's also possible to have RA with normal levels. High levels could also be related to other conditions like long-term infections, cancer, diabetes, lupus, etc.  2. Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Test: Measures proteins your body makes when there's inflammation. High levels can indicate early stages of RA.  3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate Test: Measures the speed at which your red blood cells clump and fall together. A high rate is a general sign of inflammation in your body.  4. C-Reactive Protein Test: Measures a protein your liver makes when inflammation is present. High levels suggest significant inflammation or injury in your body.  5. Antinuclear Antibody Test: Measures the presence of certain unusual antibodies in your blood. If positive, you may have an autoimmune disorder.  6. HLA-B27 Test: Measures a protein on the surface of white blood cells. It's linked to a group of conditions known as spondyloarthropathies, which involve joints and the places where ligaments and tendons attach to your bones.  7. Complete Blood Count Test: Measures red blood cells, white blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelets. It helps doctors decide if your treatments or the disease itself is causing other problems, like anemia.  8. Creatine Kinase Test: Measures levels of the muscle enzyme creatine phosphokinase. High levels might indicate an inflammatory muscle disease.  9. Complement Test: Measures more than 30 blood proteins that work together in your immune system during an inflammatory response. Lower levels of all three components may signal lupus and vasculitis, or inflamed blood vessels.  10. Cryoglobulins Test: Measures proteins that clump together when they are exposed to cold and dissolve when they are warm. There are three types of cryoglobulins, each indicating different conditions.  11. Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies Test: Measures proteins that attack white blood cells.

The document notes that between 18% and 42% of individuals with psoriasis will develop PsA. Gluten, a protein in wheat, barley, and rye, among others, can cause adverse reactions in some individuals, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea to headaches. More severe reactions may result in celiac disease, an autoimmune condition that can lead to intestinal damage and malnutrition.   Research suggests a potential link between gluten and PsA, with studies showing that people with psoriasis are three times more likely to develop celiac disease, and vice versa. However, it's unclear how many individuals have both PsA and celiac disease, and more research is needed to understand the nature of this association. Evidence so far suggests that gluten consumption does not cause PsA, and there's no indication that avoiding gluten can prevent PsA.   A gluten-free diet may lessen the severity of PsA in some individuals, particularly those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or gluten intolerance. However, the National Psoriasis Foundation does not recommend a specific diet for PsA nor does it suggest screening for gluten-related issues in all PsA patients.  The document also discusses the possibility that psoriatic disease and celiac disease might share common inflammatory and genetic pathways, although this doesn't necessarily imply one condition causes the other. People with psoriasis or PsA are also more likely to have other autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and thyroid disease.  Celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity are linked to gluten intolerance, but they're different. The former is a serious autoimmune disease with a specific immune response to gluten, while the latter presents unpleasant symptoms with gluten ingestion but does not trigger the same immune response or cause long-term damage.  The document advises against blanket testing for celiac disease or gluten sensitivity unless there's a compelling reason. However, if a patient has concerns about gluten intolerance or has a close family member with celiac disease, a consultation with a gastroenterologist may be warranted. Depending on the patient's symptoms, interventions can range from blood tests and biopsies to genetic testing and gluten elimination diets.

Diagnosis and treatment are personalized due to variations in symptoms, progression, severity, and genetic factors. There are three main types of RA: Seropositive, Seronegative, and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.  Seropositive RA is diagnosed through blood tests that detect anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs) or rheumatoid factor (RF), which are antibodies that trigger RA symptoms. About 75%-80% of RA patients have anti-CCPs, RF, or both, and these can appear on blood tests 5-10 years before symptoms manifest.   Seronegative RA is when anti-CCPs and RFs are not detected in the blood, requiring doctors to look for other indicators. Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis affects people under age 16 and is diagnosed through blood tests, X-rays, and other scans.  Typical RA symptoms include stiff, swollen, and warm joints, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. RA generally affects smaller joints first before spreading to larger ones over time. Non-joint symptoms may also occur, affecting blood vessels, nerve tissue, bones, heart, kidneys, salivary glands, lungs, skin, and eyes.   The intensity of RA symptoms varies, with fluctuations between periods of flares and remission. People with seronegative RA usually have less intense symptoms than those with seropositive RA, but this isn't always the case.   Risk factors for RA include genetic predisposition, age, sex (women are more at risk), family history, smoking, exposure to certain minerals, and obesity.   RA treatment involves medication, therapy, and possibly surgery. Medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid medications, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Hydroxychloroquine is usually taken orally, once or twice a day, and the dosage is based on body weight. It's safe to take this drug with other lupus treatments. Patients start to see symptom improvements within 1 to 3 months of starting Hydroxychloroquine, with full benefits felt after about 6 months.   Side effects are rare, but can include belly pain, nausea, diarrhea, or changes in vision. It can also make your skin and eyes more sensitive to sunlight. In rare cases, long-term use or high doses of antimalarial drugs can cause damage to the retina, but this can often be reversed.   Hydroxychloroquine is safe to take during pregnancy and might prevent stillbirths, premature births, and miscarriages in women with lupus. It may interact with certain other drugs, potentially causing heart rhythm problems. Also, smoking while taking Hydroxychloroquine is discouraged as it makes the drug less effective and can increase the risk of heart disease.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a normal person."}

Young adults with RA tend to have a more severe form, characterized by increased inflammation in small joints, bony erosions, and rheumatoid nodules. They also have a higher incidence of seropositive RA, where increased levels of proteins, such as rheumatoid factor, are released into the blood.  However, younger adults with RA tend to have better outcomes due to aggressive treatment strategies aimed at controlling the disease and preventing joint damage. This can be attributed to younger individuals having fewer age-related health problems. Biologics, a class of drugs that reduce inflammation and prevent joint damage, are often used in RA treatment but may have more side effects in older adults.  The document emphasizes the importance of exercise and managing work-life balance while living with RA. It also warns against smoking and alcohol, which can exacerbate the condition.   For young adults with RA, maintaining a social life, including dating and marriage, is possible with proper planning.

This can lead to painful inflammation affecting not just the skin, but also organs like the kidneys and lungs. Lupus also increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessel-related conditions), the leading cause of death among lupus patients.  The inflammation caused by lupus can damage the thin inner lining of your blood vessels, making heart disease start earlier in life. This risk is particularly high for young women with lupus, who are 50 times more prone to heart attacks than those without lupus. Also, certain medications used to treat lupus can potentially affect heart health as they may lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.  If you have lupus, you're at a higher risk of developing certain heart-related conditions, including atherosclerosis (buildup of substances in your arteries), inflammation of the heart, vasculitis (inflammation in your blood vessels), high blood pressure, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (clots in the vessels that supply blood to your brain, heart, or lungs).   Common symptoms of heart-related issues include chest pain, swelling, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and irregular heartbeat. If you notice any of these symptoms, it's important to consult your doctor.   Doctors from various specialties can work together to design a treatment plan to lower your risk of heart disease and manage any issues that develop. Tests like blood tests, angiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography can be used to diagnose your condition and monitor your heart health.

These conditions include Lyme Disease, Psoriatic Arthritis, Sjgrens Syndrome, Gout, Fibromyalgia, and Lupus.   In Lyme Disease, a tick bite causes symptoms like fatigue, headaches, fever, and rash. If untreated, it can spread to your joints, nervous system, or heart, with arthritis being a common outcome. However, this usually resolves with antibiotic treatment.   Psoriatic Arthritis often affects people with psoriasis and, like RA, it's a long-lasting autoimmune disorder. Key differences include the presence of skin or nail psoriasis and different patterns of pain and swelling.  Sjgrens Syndrome, another autoimmune disease, harms glands that make moisture in your eyes, mouth, and other parts of your body, but can also cause joint inflammation like RA. It has several symptoms that don't usually occur with RA, such as eye irritation and mouth dryness.  Gout happens when uric acid builds up in your joints, causing pain and inflammation. It can mimic RA but typically starts with severe pain and swelling in one area, often the big toe.   Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder causing pain, stiffness, and fatigue due to increased brain processing of pain signals. Both fibromyalgia and RA can cause joint pain, sleep problems, and stiffness, but RA causes visible joint harm and inflammation.  Lupus, another autoimmune disease, may affect your joints like RA but also harms other body parts like skin, kidneys, and heart.

It can affect your health in other ways due to the inflammation it causes. This inflammation can lead to complications such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mood disorders, spondylitis, and uveitis.   PsA increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by over 40%. The body struggles to use insulin properly, causing a build-up of sugar in the blood. This could be due to inflammation, but lifestyle factors such as inactivity or an unhealthy diet can also contribute.  Heart disease is another potential problem. PsA can lead to heart problems, especially if you are overweight or have diabetes. The inflammation may cause a build-up of fatty plaques in your blood vessels, making it harder for your heart to pump blood and possibly leading to a heart attack or stroke.  IBD, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can also occur, causing inflammation, cramping, pain, and severe diarrhea. PsA and IBD share certain genetic features and inflammation triggers, so some treatments may work for both.  Mood disorders like depression are common with PsA. The inflammation can cause changes in the brain leading to these disorders. If you're feeling persistently sad or losing interest in activities you once enjoyed, speak to your doctor.  Spondylitis, another type of arthritis, causes inflammation in the bones of your spine, leading to pain and stiffness. In severe cases, the spine bones can fuse together, making it hard to bend your back.  Uveitis is an eye condition caused by PsA, leading to pain, redness, and blurry vision. If untreated, it can lead to vision loss.  To manage these complications, it's advised to stay active, maintain a healthy diet, and keep a healthy weight. If you smoke, it's recommended to quit.

Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis, causing stiffness, pain, and swelling in joints. It can occur in any part of the body, and its signs might also be indicative of other diseases.   Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder resulting from an immune system attack on the body's tissue. It can affect joints, skin, eyes, lungs, blood vessels, and the heart, with symptoms including tender, swollen, and stiff joints, which are typically more intense in the morning.  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis. It occurs when the cartilage that protects the ends of bones wears down, usually affecting hands, hip, knee, and spine joints. Symptoms tend to develop slowly and worsen over time, with pain, stiffness, tenderness, loss of flexibility, bone spurs, and swelling being common.  Gout is a common, complex form of arthritis causing sudden pain attacks, swelling, redness, and tenderness in joints, often affecting the big toes. It's linked with high uric acid levels, as is PsA.  Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease causing inflammation and pain in various parts of the body, commonly skin, joints, and internal organs. Arthritis is a common symptom, but it's rare for it to be the only sign of lupus.  Fibromyalgia, a disorder causing musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and cognitive issues, is more likely to occur in people with PsA. Its primary symptoms include widespread dull pain, fatigue due to sleep disorders or poor sleep, and cognitive troubles.  Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory disease causing the small bones in the spine to fuse over time. It usually affects the back and hip joints, unlike PsA, which also causes pain in hand and foot joints.  Plantar Fasciitis, a common condition causing heel pain, is more likely to occur in people with PsA. It causes stabbing pain in the bottom of the foot near the heel.  Lyme Disease, an infection caused by bacteria from an infected blacklegged tick, can spread to the heart, nervous system, or joints if untreated.

The most common symptom is pain in the affected joints after repetitive use, with pain often intensifying later in the day. OA can also cause swelling, warmth, and creaking of the affected joints, with pain and stiffness also occurring after long periods of inactivity. Severe OA can lead to complete cartilage loss, causing bone friction, which results in resting pain or pain during limited motion.   Symptoms of OA can vary greatly between patients, with some experiencing debilitating symptoms while others have few symptoms despite significant joint degeneration seen in X-rays. Symptoms can also be intermittent. It's not uncommon for patients with OA of the hands and knees to experience pain-free intervals lasting years.   OA of the knees is often related to obesity or a history of repeated injury and/or joint surgery. As the cartilage degeneration progresses, deformity and outward curvature of the knees can occur, leading to a bow-legged appearance. Affected patients may develop a limp, which can worsen as cartilage degeneration continues. In cases where pain, limping, and joint dysfunction do not respond to medications or other conservative measures, total knee replacement surgery may be necessary.  OA can also affect the spine, causing neck or lower back pain. Bony spurs formed along the arthritic spine can irritate spinal nerves, resulting in severe pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected body parts.   In the fingers, OA can cause the formation of hard bony enlargements of the small joints. These nodules, known as Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, may not be painful but can limit joint motion.

It's not inevitable with aging, however, and there are ways to prevent or slow its progression.  1. Control Weight: Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent osteoarthritis as being overweight puts extra stress on your joints, especially knees, hips, and feet. If you're overweight, losing even 5% of your body weight can reduce this stress and decrease your risk of osteoarthritis.   2. Exercise: Regular exercise, particularly strength training focusing on the muscles at the front of your thigh (the quadriceps), can help reduce the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Low-impact exercises like bicycling, swimming, and light weight lifting are recommended. If you already have osteoarthritis, consult your doctor before starting a new exercise regime.  3. Avoid Injuries: Joint injuries can increase your risk of osteoarthritis. To prevent injuries, follow safe exercise practices such as doing warm-up exercises before sports, wearing properly fitting shoes, and avoiding high-impact movements. If you do experience a joint injury, seek immediate medical treatment.  4. Eat Right: While no specific diet prevents osteoarthritis, certain nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may reduce the risk or severity of the disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish oil and certain plant/nut oils, while vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight and foods like fatty fish, fortified milk and cereal, and eggs.  If you already have osteoarthritis, the same steps can help manage your symptoms. Additionally, there are treatments your doctor can recommend, including over-the-counter pain relievers, corticosteroid injections, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a patient."}

While it doesn't cause you to get ulcerative colitis, your diet can affect the symptoms you experience, particularly during a flare-up. Foods like broccoli, cauliflower, beans, and whole grains, which can cause gas, may worsen symptoms. Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, can help. It's also recommended to keep a diary of what you eat and how you feel afterward to help identify potential problem foods. In a flare-up, it may be beneficial to follow a low-residue diet, avoiding hard-to-digest foods or foods with indigestible fiber such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.   Ulcerative colitis can lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron, putting people at risk for anemia. Women of childbearing age need to be careful as the disease can also deplete folate, which can lead to birth defects. Ulcerative colitis is also associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. Smoking and stress can worsen symptoms, so it's recommended to quit smoking and find ways to manage stress.   There are several types of medications available to treat ulcerative colitis, including aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and biologics. These can reduce inflammation, help manage symptoms, and prevent flare-ups. Surgery is a last resort, usually considered when medication doesn't work or if there are cancerous areas in the colon.

Doctors often rely on your description of symptoms and a physical examination, particularly checking for tender points on your body. Common symptoms include constant or intermittent pain, tiredness and cognitive issues. It's helpful to keep a detailed record of your symptoms to assist the doctor.  Several other conditions can cause similar symptoms, including hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. Your doctor might need to conduct blood tests, check hormone levels, look for signs of inflammation, or even do X-rays to rule out these conditions.  If no other cause for your symptoms is found, your doctor might use a two-part process to diagnose fibromyalgia. This involves assessing widespread pain in your body and the severity of your symptoms. They may also consider the presence of about 40 other symptoms that can affect people with fibromyalgia, such as depression, anxiety, bellyaches, itching, taste changes, numbness, and dizziness.  The diagnosis process also involves a scoring system. If you meet certain criteria in terms of scores and symptom duration, and no other condition can explain your symptoms, you might be diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

It mentions that symptoms and severity can vary from person to person, and as such, the treatments can differ too. The three main types of RA are Seropositive, Seronegative, and Juvenile Ideopathic Arthritis.  Seropositive RA is diagnosed through blood tests that find certain substances. Seronegative RA is diagnosed when these substances don't show up in the blood, and Juvenile Ideopathic Arthritis affects people under 16. The symptoms of RA can include stiff joints, swelling, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. It typically starts in the smaller joints like fingers and toes and can eventually spread to larger ones.  The severity of symptoms can vary, with periods of increased symptoms (flares) and periods of reduced symptoms (remission). Factors like age, gender, family history, smoking, environmental factors, and obesity can increase your risk of RA.  While there is no cure for RA, there are various treatments available to manage symptoms. These include medication to ease swelling and pain, corticosteroid medications to reduce joint damage, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs to slow down RA progression, and biologic agents for severe cases.

These drugs include Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), Biologic response modifiers, Glucocorticoids, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and Analgesics.   DMARDs are deemed essential in slowing or stopping RA progression by interrupting the immune process that promotes inflammation. However, they may take up to 6 months to be fully effective and may result in various side effects, including stomach upset, liver problems, and blood problems due to their impact on the immune system.  Biologic Response Modifiers, a type of DMARD, specifically target the part of the immune system that leads to inflammation and joint damage, though their long-term effects are currently unknown.  Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that may stop or slow joint damage. However, due to the risk of side effects, they are recommended for brief periods such as during disease flare-ups.  NSAIDs work by blocking an enzyme that promotes inflammation, helping to reduce swelling and pain. However, they are not effective in reducing joint damage and should be taken along with other RA medications.  Analgesics, while useful in reducing pain, do not reduce swelling or joint damage.

These two conditions are linked to the immune system mistakenly attacking body tissues, resulting in joint pain, swelling, and skin symptoms.   Research suggests that hormonal fluctuations may trigger immune changes in the skin. Psoriasis symptoms tend to spike during puberty, post-childbirth, and at menopause, while psoriatic arthritis symptoms might improve post-pregnancy. This is likely due to the immune system's adaptability during pregnancy to prevent rejection of the fetus, with high levels of pregnancy hormones, particularly estrogen, potentially causing relief from psoriatic disease.  A study on 29 women with psoriatic arthritis showed symptom improvement or stability during pregnancy in almost 60% of cases. However, symptom response to pregnancy can vary greatly between women and between different pregnancies for the same woman. Effective management of psoriatic disease symptoms before pregnancy may improve outcomes.  Delivery may cause a relapse of symptoms as post-partum hormone levels plummet and the immune system reverts to its previous state. For some, joint symptoms may improve while others might worsen, and some women may experience psoriatic arthritis for the first time postpartum.  Menopause can also trigger psoriatic symptoms due to falling estrogen levels. In one study, nearly half of the women reported a flare-up of psoriasis post-menopause.

This could be due to inflammation or lifestyle factors like inactivity or unhealthy diet. Maintaining regular activity, a healthy diet, and weight can help manage blood sugar levels and reduce this risk.  PsA is also linked to an increased risk of heart disease, potentially due to inflammation leading to the build-up of plaques in the blood vessels. This results in the heart working harder, increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke. Quitting smoking, weight management, blood sugar control, regular exercise, and a heart-healthy diet can help prevent these issues.  Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can also occur in PsA patients. This is because PsA and IBD share genetic features and are both inflammation-related conditions. Some PsA medications can exacerbate IBD, so patients must discuss their treatment plan with their doctor.  Depression and other mood disorders are common in PsA patients due to the impact of inflammation-triggering proteins on the brain. If patients experience persistent sadness or loss of enjoyment in regular activities, they should seek help from a mental health professional.  Spondylitis, arthritis that impacts the spine, is another potential complication of PsA. This condition can lead to pain and stiffness in the lower back and potentially cause the fusion of spinal bones, leading to a stooped posture. Regular exercise can help manage these symptoms.

Risk factors include obesity, joint injuries or surgeries, congenital joint abnormalities, abnormal body mechanics, repetitive joint use due to certain jobs or hobbies, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, other inflammatory conditions of the joints, diabetes, other hormonal disorders, and menopause where estrogen levels, which protect bones and cartilage, drop. These conditions can lead to stress on the joints, crystal deposits in the cartilage causing damage, inflammation leading to osteoarthritis, and cartilage breakdown respectively.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/lupus/what-is-drug-induced-lupus", "category": "arthritis", "perspective": "doctor", "summary": "doctor : The medical document discusses Lupus, specifically drug-induced lupus, where the body's immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs due to prolonged use of certain prescription medicines. Unlike typical Lupus, drug-induced lupus usually doesn't affect major organs like kidneys or lungs, and it's mostly temporary, with symptoms subsiding a few weeks or months after discontinuing the causative medicine.   People aged 50 or older are more susceptible to drug-induced lupus. Common medications associated with this condition include Hydralazine (for hypertension), Isoniazid (for tuberculosis), Minocycline (for infections and acne), Procainamide, and Quinidine (both for heart rhythm problems). Other drug classes linked to the disease include antibiotics, antifungals, anti-inflammatories, antihypertensives, arthritis medications, and antiepileptics.   However, not everyone taking these medications will develop drug-induced lupus. Symptoms, similar to regular lupus, can include muscle pain, joint pain with possible swelling, fever, fatigue, weight loss, and inflammation around the lungs or heart causing pain or discomfort. These symptoms can appear anywhere from 3 weeks to 2 years after starting the medication.  Diagnosing drug-induced lupus can be challenging due to the delay in symptom onset after starting the medication. The physician may rely on medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests (blood and urine samples) to rule out other immune system conditions. If symptoms improve after discontinuing certain medications, drug-induced lupus could be the likely diagnosis.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are related conditions caused by the immune system erroneously attacking the body's tissues. Psoriasis can cause red, scaly patches of skin, while psoriatic arthritis can cause joint pain and swelling.   Hormonal changes during puberty can trigger or worsen these conditions, with many women reporting a flare-up right before their period. During pregnancy, the immune system changes to prevent the body from rejecting the baby. This change, along with high levels of pregnancy hormones, may provide some women with temporary relief from psoriatic disease. However, the improvement is often short-lived, with symptoms often flaring up a few weeks after delivery.  Menopause can also trigger symptoms due to falling estrogen levels. This can cause psoriatic arthritis, hot flashes, night sweats, and worsening skin conditions. Hormone replacement therapy and birth control pills have not been strongly linked with improving psoriasis symptoms.  The document also notes that stress is a significant trigger for psoriatic disease. Stressful periods can coincide with hormonal changes, such as caring for a newborn or dealing with sleep problems during menopause. Reducing stress through methods like meditation, yoga, or walks might help manage symptoms. It's also recommended to discuss any plans for pregnancy with healthcare providers due to potential medication adjustments.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a patient."}

It covers four classes of drugs: NSAIDs, Steroids, DMARDs, and Biologics.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen, Naproxen, and Aspirin are used to alleviate joint pain and inflammation. Potential side effects include stomach upset, heartburn, ulcers, and increased risk of heart disease or stroke. Intake with food or antacids can alleviate stomach problems, and serious side effects should prompt immediate medical attention.  Steroids like Prednisone, Hydrocortisone, Methylprednisolone, and Dexamethasone are used to manage inflammation, swelling, and pain. Side effects include high blood pressure, weight gain, mood changes, sleep problems, weak bones, increased risk of infections, and high blood sugar. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise can manage these side effects. Regular checkups and eye exams are necessary for monitoring.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like Methotrexate, Azathioprine, Hydroxychloroquine, Leflunomide, Sulfasalazine, and Cyclosporine treat inflammation, pain, and swelling, and slow RA's effects. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, internal bleeding, infection, mouth sores, and birth defects in pregnancy. Taking these drugs after meals, using folic acid supplements, and regular liver tests can manage these side effects.  Biologic drugs like Abatacept, Adalimumab, Anakinra, Certolizumab pegol, Etanercept, Golimumab, Infliximab, Rituximab, Tofacitinib, and Tocilizumab stop RA inflammation by targeting the immune system. Side effects include infections, headaches, nausea, redness around the injection site, allergic reactions, and less commonly, vision problems, numbness, rash, swelling, shortness of breath, heart failure, and serious infections. Applying a cool cloth or steroid cream can ease injection site reactions, and good hygiene can lower the risk of infections. Immediate medical care is required for serious side effects.

The primary aim of treatment involves controlling the inflammation leading to joint swelling and pain, ultimately preventing further damage.   Various treatment methods are discussed, including medications, surgery, light therapy, lifestyle changes, and complementary therapies. Initial treatment usually involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, though these can have side effects such as heart attacks, stomach issues, and bleeding. If NSAIDs prove ineffective, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like Leflunomide, Methotrexate, and Sulfasalazine are recommended. These medications slow or stop joint and tissue damage and can help manage pain and swelling.   Immunosuppressants like Azathioprine and Cyclosporine are also discussed as potential treatments, as they suppress the immune system, which is typically overactive in autoimmune conditions like PsA. However, these medications can increase the likelihood of infections. For severe or unresponsive disease, biologics may be prescribed, which block specific proteins causing inflammation.   A new drug, Apremilast, an enzyme inhibitor, is mentioned for long-term inflammatory diseases like PsA. It works by blocking a specific enzyme (PDE-4) that leads to inflammation. Corticosteroids are also discussed as powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can provide relief from severe pain and swelling.   Surgery, while not commonly needed, can relieve pain, improve joint function, and enhance mobility when other treatments fail. The document also discusses light therapy, which can help manage psoriasis skin plaques, although this method requires careful supervision due to potential skin damage and risk of skin cancer.   The document also emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes, including a healthy diet (like the Mediterranean diet), regular exercise, stress management, rest, and avoiding alcohol. Complementary and alternative therapies like acupressure, acupuncture, curcumin, massage, reiki, tai chi, yoga, and vitamin D are proposed, subject to consultation with a healthcare professional.

This disease causes the body to attack its own joint fluid, leading to inflammation. The number of people with RA has been steady over the years, but there has been a decrease in rheumatoid factor-positive RA and an increase in RF-negative RA, which is harder to diagnose.   Lifestyle factors like obesity and smoking, and genetic factors, can influence the risk of developing RA. For instance, if you have a close family member with RA, your chances of having it increase. However, RA is not strictly an inherited disease since many people get it without a family history.   Smoking is a significant risk factor, and being overweight also increases your risk. On the other hand, a high-calorie, low-fiber diet increases the chances of developing RA, while eating foods with omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk.  RA is a progressive disease with no cure, and it tends to worsen over time. However, with early treatment, the disease's symptoms can be managed better. While it can affect anyone, it's most common among people aged 30 to 60. Some children also have juvenile RA, but it's not common.  Unfortunately, people with RA have a shorter lifespan compared to those without the disease. However, many people with RA still live into their 80s and 90s.

The primary treatments include immunosuppressants and other drugs that help manage symptoms and prevent permanent damage.   1. Anifrolumab, approved in 2021, is used to treat moderate to severe lupus in adults, particularly improving arthritis and skin rashes. It's administered through a 30-minute infusion once every 4 weeks. Side effects include respiratory tract infections, herpes, cough, bronchitis, back pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting. It hasn't been evaluated for lupus nephritis or CNS affecting lupus.  2. Azathioprine, another immunosuppressant, helps reduce joint symptoms and damage. It's taken as a pill once daily, with relief seen in 6-8 weeks and full effect at 12 weeks. Side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and increased risk of infections.  3. Belimumab was approved in 2011 for adults and in 2019 for children with lupus. It blocks a specific protein that produces antibodies which can mistakenly attack the joints, skin, and other organs. Side effects include nausea, diarrhoea, fever, muscle aches, respiratory and urinary tract infections, and depression.  4. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation in lupus patients. These are usually given in tablets up to four times a day or as an injection. Side effects increase with higher doses and longer treatment times and include acne, muscle weakness, weight gain, irritability, insomnia, and increased risk of infection.  5. Cyclosporine is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug that relieves pain, swelling, and stiffness in joints. It's taken orally twice a day, with full effect seen at about 3 months. Side effects include high blood pressure, gout, headaches, and stomach pain.  6. Hydroxychloroquine, originally developed to treat malaria, is also effective against lupus. It reduces pain and inflammation and cuts down on lupus flares and skin symptoms.  7. Leflunomide is both a DMARD and an immunosuppressant, often prescribed for patients who have not responded well to methotrexate.   8. Methotrexate, originally developed to treat cancer, is now a standard immunosuppressive treatment for lupus.   9. Mycophenolate Mofetil treats symptoms of lupus-related kidney disease. It's taken twice a day by mouth as a capsule, tablet, or liquid.  10. Rituximab calms down the overactive immune system by attaching to certain proteins on the surface of immune system cells, causing them to die.  11. Voclosporin, approved in January 2021, is used to treat lupus nephritis. It's taken as a pill twice a day, with side effects including high blood pressure, diarrhoea, headache, anemia, cough, and a greater risk of infections.

RA can lead to inflammation in various body parts, causing complications that pose risks to organs and life.   The most common symptoms of RA include joint stiffness, pain, and fatigue. RA and associated medications like steroids can weaken bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Patients are advised to engage in weight-bearing exercises to strengthen their bones.   RA also increases the likelihood of heart disease, leading to atherosclerosis, or plaque buildup in the arteries, which can result in heart attacks. Chest pain is a common symptom. RA can also cause pericarditis, an inflammation of the heart tissue layers.  RA is associated with dryness, specifically dry eyes, which raises the risk of eye infections. This can be a sign of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, another autoimmune condition that leads to dryness in various body parts. RA can also cause inflammation in the eye's white part, leading to redness, pain, and blurred vision.  Fever in RA patients can signal an infection, as the disease and its medications, like biologics and steroids, can weaken the immune system. Fever can also be a sign of an RA flare, where inflammation spikes.  RA patients may experience hearing loss and tinnitus, possibly due to side effects of treatments like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  Mood changes, including depression and anxiety, are linked to RA due to the pain, fatigue, and stiffness it causes. The inflammation associated with RA can also lead to these mood changes, and some patients may also develop fibromyalgia.  RA can also affect small nerves, resulting in numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. In severe cases, this can lead to rheumatoid vasculitis, which can cause pain and damage to the nerves.  RA and the medicines used for its treatment can cause digestive issues including mouth and stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, acid reflux, diarrhea, constipation, diverticulitis, and colitis. Belly pain can be a sign of a rare complication called rheumatoid vasculitis.  Finally, RA can cause breathing difficulties, particularly in men who smoke or used to smoke.

It is generally safe to be used alongside other lupus treatments like steroids, NSAIDs, immunosuppressants, or cytotoxic drugs. The full benefits are usually felt after about six months of treatment.   Side effects occur in about 10% of lupus patients taking Hydroxychloroquine, and may include gastrointestinal issues, vision changes, skin and eye sensitivity to sunlight, and possible changes in skin tone. Rarer side effects include headaches, muscle aches, nervousness, dizziness, and worsening psoriasis. Very rare side effects include confusion, seizures, cardiomyopathy, heart rhythm changes, and anemia.   Hydroxychloroquine can potentially cause retinal damage with long-term or high-dose use, so regular eye exams are recommended. The drug is safe to use during pregnancy and can even help to prevent stillbirths, premature births, and miscarriages in women with lupus.   Possible drug interactions include amiodarone, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, antiemetics for nausea, cimetidine, clopidogrel, gemfibrozil, antifungals, antibiotics, cyclosporine, and digoxin. It is advised not to smoke while taking Hydroxychloroquine as it makes the drug less effective and increases the risk of heart disease. It is also important not to stop taking the drug without medical advice as it can lead to a flare-up of lupus symptoms.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Axial psoriatic arthritis, one of the five types of psoriatic arthritis, principally affects the spine and is closely associated with sacroiliitis, inflammation of the sacroiliac joints. Common symptoms include stiffness and pain in the lower back, buttocks, or thighs, which tends to improve with activity and worsen with inactivity.   Diagnosis is typically achieved through a combination of patient history, physical examination, and imaging studies (X-ray and MRI). Blood tests and joint fluid analysis may be done to rule out other conditions.   The recommended treatment approach for axial psoriatic arthritis and sacroiliitis is a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. NSAIDs are usually the first line of treatment, followed by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as TNF inhibitors if the condition is moderate to severe.   Lifestyle modifications that can aid in managing the condition include a balanced diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, getting adequate sleep, and quitting smoking.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

No single item conclusively diagnoses psoriatic arthritis, but a combination of tests can lead to a confident diagnosis. Blood tests and imaging, such as X-rays, are particularly valuable. The link to rheumatoid arthritis is critical, as the two conditions present similarly, and tests for rheumatoid arthritis can help rule out this alternative diagnosis.   Key signs of psoriatic arthritis include skin and nail changes associated with psoriasis and specific alterations in X-ray images. A referral to a rheumatologist, a specialist in arthritis and related conditions, is often necessary for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.   The onset of psoriatic arthritis usually occurs between ages 30 and 50, and symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, fatigue, tendon and ligament tenderness, and skin changes. The condition is genetic, increasing the likelihood for those with a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.  To diagnose psoriatic arthritis, a points system is utilized, including skin psoriasis (current or past), nail lesions, dactylitis, negative rheumatoid factor, and juxta-articular bone formation.   Blood tests, such as Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and HLA-B27, can confirm psoriatic arthritis and exclude other conditions. X-Rays can reveal cartilage, bone, and joint damage, and a Bone Density Scan may be conducted to assess the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. A Joint Fluid Test can rule out gout, another potential cause of joint pain.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Some common symptoms include rashes, muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, fever, sensitivity to sunlight, hair loss, mouth sores, dry eyes, unexplained tiredness, stomach, chest, or head pain, breathing problems, brain fog, and depressed mood.   If you notice these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical attention. Your doctor will examine you, listen to your symptoms, and take your family medical history into account. If they suspect lupus, they will conduct some laboratory tests using your blood and urine samples.   There are several types of blood tests used to help diagnose lupus, including ANA, APL, Anti-Sm, Anti-dsDNA, Anti-Ro and Anti-La, C-Reactive Protein, Complement, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Complete Blood Cell Count, and a Chemistry Panel. Each of these tests measures different components in your body, such as inflammation, antibodies, and blood cell counts.   While all these tests can indicate lupus, none can diagnose it definitively on its own. The results must be considered alongside your symptoms and medical history. For instance, a positive ANA test is common in people with lupus, but it can also occur in individuals with other diseases or even in some healthy people.   Moreover, these tests are not only used for diagnosis but also to monitor the disease's progression and the effectiveness of the treatment. For instance, levels of Anti-dsDNA can increase as the disease becomes more active, indicating a need for treatment adjustment.   Remember, if you suspect you have lupus or have been diagnosed, regular monitoring and adherence to your treatment plan are essential.

Some may experience prolonged periods with little to no symptoms, while others may feel the disease's effects for months at a time, known as a flare.  The most common symptoms of RA are joint inflammation, pain, swelling, and tenderness. These symptoms usually start in the hands and may extend to other parts of the body such as the elbows, wrists, ankles, toes, hips, jaw, knees, neck, and shoulders. Joints are often stiff, especially in the morning, and may appear red and warm due to inflammation.  RA can affect more than just your joints. You may also experience fatigue, muscle aches, poor appetite, and depression. Sometimes, you might feel bad all over. Extreme fatigue could be a sign of anemia, and depression could also cause some of these symptoms.  In some cases, RA can cause symptoms that affect your skin, heart, lungs, eyes, bones, liver, kidneys, immune system, mucous membranes, muscles, nerves, and even blood vessels. Some people with RA get rheumatoid nodules, which are bumps under the skin that usually appear on the elbows but may show up on other bony areas.  In the lungs, RA can cause chest pain that worsens with breathing, shortness of breath, and even pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that makes it tough to breathe. In the heart, it can cause inflammation, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Vision-related complications include cataracts and dry eyes.  The disease can also affect the bones, often affecting the hips and spine. It can affect the liver and kidneys, immune system, dry out mucous membranes, weaken muscles, cause numbness and tingling in nerves, and inflame blood vessels.

The exact cause of lupus isn't known, but it may be related to genetic factors, environmental triggers, sunlight, stress, and certain medicines.   There are three types of lupus: Systemic lupus erythematosus, which is the most common and can affect many parts of the body; Discoid lupus erythematosus, which primarily affects the skin, causing a red circular rash or color changes; and Drug-induced lupus, which is caused by specific drugs, usually resolves after stopping the medication, and is more common in men due to the heart medications that trigger it.  Lupus symptoms vary greatly, making it hard to diagnose. Common symptoms include a red rash or color change on the face, swollen or painful joints, unexplained fever, chest pain during deep breathing, swollen glands, extreme fatigue, unusual hair loss, pale or purple fingers or toes, sensitivity to the sun, low blood count, and mental health issues like depression and memory problems. Other possible signs include mouth sores, unexplained seizures, hallucinations, repeated miscarriages, and kidney problems.  Treatment for lupus depends on your specific symptoms. Options include over-the-counter medications like aspirin for fever and swollen joints, creams for rashes, and stronger prescription medications for more serious issues.

A severe form, Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC), is diagnosed in 10-20% of these patients, often presenting with increased bowel movements, bloody diarrhea, rapid heart rate, and high levels of inflammation. Complications may include toxic megacolon and anemia.  ASUC is a medical emergency requiring immediate hospitalization for management. Patients typically undergo a series of tests including blood and stool tests, and sigmoidoscopy. Treatment primarily involves intravenous fluids and steroid medications to control symptoms and induce remission, with the average hospital stay ranging from 4.6 to 12.5 days. However, steroids are ineffective in 30-40% of ASUC patients, escalating to medical rescue therapy with immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporine or infliximab. Colectomy (removal of part of the colon) may be necessary if the disease does not respond to treatments or in cases of colon perforation or toxic megacolon. Emerging therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors show promise in reducing the need for colectomy.  Most ulcerative colitis diagnoses are in males aged 15 to 35. ASUC typically manifests between ages 34 and 48. Research indicates 54% of ASUC cases occur within 1 year of ulcerative colitis diagnosis, 18% within 1-5 years, and 28% over 5 years. Patients diagnosed before age 40, with extensive or deep colonic ulcers, early steroid prescriptions, and high levels of inflammation are at higher risk for severe disease, including ASUC. Men have a higher risk of requiring colectomy.  Long-term prognosis for ASUC is uncertain, with a 20-40% chance of requiring colectomy after the first or second hospital admission.

While having UC doesn't guarantee these problems, it's important to be aware of them.  Depression and anxiety can be more prevalent in people with UC due to its painful symptoms and disruptions to daily life. If you're feeling depressed or anxious, discuss it with your doctor. There are treatments available like therapy, medication, or joining a support group. Exercise can also help improve your mood.  UC can cause symptoms in other parts of the body, like skin rashes, joint pain, and eye problems. Always inform your doctor about any new symptoms, so they can adjust your treatment plan accordingly.  Rectal bleeding can occur due to inflammation of UC, which can lead to anemia (a condition where you lack enough red blood cells). Anemia can make you feel tired or weak, but can be treated with iron supplements, diet changes or, in severe cases, blood transfusions.  Dehydration and malabsorption are also potential issues, as UC can prevent your large intestine from properly absorbing water and nutrients. In such cases, hospital treatment may be necessary.  UC can lead to osteoporosis or osteopenia, conditions that weaken your bones. If this happens, your doctor may recommend medications or supplements to slow down bone loss.  Children with UC may experience growth and development issues, such as being underweight or going through puberty later than usual. However, controlling UC inflammation can help a child grow normally.  Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein, is another potential risk. If you suspect you have DVT, contact your doctor straight away as it can lead to a lung artery blockage, a serious emergency.  People with UC have a slightly increased risk of colorectal cancer. To minimize this risk, follow your UC treatment plan, and get regular colonoscopies as recommended by your doctor.   Other severe complications of UC include Fulminant Ulcerative Colitis, bowel perforation, and Toxic Megacolon, which are all rare but can be life-threatening.

The document further outlines a series of blood tests used to confirm a lupus diagnosis. These include the Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) test, which is present in almost all people with active lupus. However, a positive result doesn't necessarily indicate lupus as it can also appear in other diseases and in people without any autoimmune disorders.   Antiphospholipid Antibodies (APLs) are found in up to 60% of lupus patients and can help confirm a diagnosis. Anti-Sm, an antibody directed against the protein Sm, is found in only 30% of lupus patients but can confirm a diagnosis due to its rarity in non-lupus individuals.   Anti-dsDNA, a protein directed against double-stranded DNA, is found in between 75% and 90% of lupus patients and can be used to confirm a diagnosis and measure disease activity. A positive result also indicates a greater risk of lupus nephritis, a kidney inflammation that occurs with lupus.

This condition can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death amongst systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sufferers. The inflammation can harm the endothelium, the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to early-onset CVD. Young women with lupus are especially at risk, being 50 times more likely to experience a heart attack than their healthy counterparts.   Treatment steroids may also adversely affect heart health, potentially causing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, conditions that elevate heart disease risk. Over half of SLE patients will develop lupus-associated cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis, pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis, vasculitis, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, each of which can lead to other CVD problems.   Common heart inflammation symptoms include chest pain, body swelling, fatigue during activity, and breathing difficulties. Vasculitis symptoms include fever, weight loss, rash, and eye or brain problems, while skin conditions like Raynauds phenomenon, livedo reticularis, and palmar erythema indicate problems with subdermal blood vessels.   Managing lupus-related CVD issues often requires a multidisciplinary approach. Cardiologists can collaborate with the patient's primary physician to adjust lupus medications to protect heart health. Diagnostic tools for CVD include blood tests, angiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Treatment strategies are tailored to the specific condition, potentially including statins for atherosclerosis, steroids or NSAIDs for pericarditis, high-dose steroids for myocarditis, and antibiotics for endocarditis.   Patients can also take proactive steps to protect their cardiovascular health, including adhering to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, maintaining a healthy body weight, and engaging in regular exercise.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain throughout the body, including painful tender points, deep muscle pain, chronic headaches, back pain, or neck pain. It's highlighted that fibromyalgia pain is not just a symptom, but becomes the disease itself.   This condition is associated with a hypersensitivity to stimuli that are typically non-painful, believed to be caused by a \"glitch\" in the body's pain processing system. This is further exacerbated by reduced blood flow to parts of the brain that manage pain. The pain in fibromyalgia is chronic, persisting longer than expected from the original cause or injury and is often associated with neurochemical changes, mood disorders, and impaired mental and physical performance.   Tender points, which are localized areas of tenderness above muscles, tendons, or bones, are a characteristic of fibromyalgia, with patients often having 11 or more out of a possible 18 tender points.   The chronic nature of fibromyalgia pain results in significant life impacts including sleep disorders, fatigue, and difficulties with social interactions and everyday activities.

Most people with RA experience joint damage, particularly in the first two years, especially in small joints like wrists, hands, and feet. Symptoms can include joint pain, swelling, stiffness, discomfort for at least six weeks, morning stiffness that lasts at least 30 minutes, fatigue, and loss of appetite.   Diagnosing RA can be difficult as it can resemble other diseases like Lupus, Sjogrens syndrome, Psoriatic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, and Osteoarthritis. Therefore, doctors use several methods to diagnose RA including personal and family medical history, physical exams, and blood tests. In blood tests, doctors look for certain proteins that indicate RA.   Imaging tests like X-rays, MRI, and ultrasound can help doctors judge the severity of the disease and track its progress. However, these scans are not usually used to diagnose RA, but they can help find it early.   There are many other conditions that your doctor may consider instead of RA, including viral arthritis, palindromic rheumatism, and polymyalgia rheumatica.   While there is no cure for RA, it is manageable. Treatment options include medications like anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying drugs.

It mentions four main types of RA medications: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), Biologic response modifiers, Glucocorticoids, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and Analgesics.   DMARDs can slow or stop the progression of RA by reducing inflammation. They are often used with NSAIDs or glucocorticoids, but they might weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infection. Regular blood tests are needed to monitor this.  Biologic response modifiers, a type of DMARD, target the part of the immune system that leads to inflammation and joint damage. They improve the condition and relieve symptoms but don't cure RA. They're expensive, taken by injection or IV, and their long-term effects aren't known.  Glucocorticoids, or steroids, are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can block other immune responses and relieve RA symptoms. They're used for short periods during disease flare-ups.  NSAIDs reduce inflammation, swelling, and pain but don't reduce joint damage. They should be taken with other RA medications and used for short periods due to potential severe digestive tract problems.  Analgesics only reduce pain and don't impact swelling or joint damage.

By the age of 65, over half the population will have X-ray evidence of this condition. However, it's not an inevitable part of aging and can be prevented or slowed in progression. Four steps are suggested for prevention and management:  1. Weight Control: Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial. Obesity is a significant risk factor, with obese individuals at a much higher risk than their non-obese counterparts. Weight loss of at least 5% can decrease stress on weight-bearing joints such as knees, hips, and lower back.  2. Exercise: Regular exercise, especially that which strengthens the quadriceps, is recommended. This can reduce the risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. Low impact exercises including bicycling, swimming, or light weight lifting are suggested.  3. Injury Prevention/Treatment: Joint injuries, both in youth and adulthood, predispose individuals to osteoarthritis. Hence, it's important to avoid injuries and seek prompt medical treatment if an injury occurs.  4. Healthy Diet: While no specific diet prevents osteoarthritis, certain nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D are associated with reduced risk and severity of the disease.

Blood tests, however, can be conducted to rule out other conditions that may cause secondary osteoarthritis or mimic its symptoms. The primary diagnostic tool is X-ray imaging of the affected joints, which often reveals loss of joint cartilage, narrowed joint space, and bone spur formation. These X-ray findings not only aid in identifying osteoarthritis, but also help in ruling out other sources of joint pain, enabling informed decisions about potential surgical interventions.  Arthrocentesis, which involves the extraction of joint fluid for analysis, is another diagnostic method performed in the physician's office. It aids in ruling out conditions such as gout, infections, and other inflammatory arthritides. In addition, corticosteroid injection into the joints during arthrocentesis may help alleviate pain, swelling, and inflammation.  Arthroscopy, a surgical technique allowing direct visualization of the joint space, can detect and sometimes repair cartilage and ligament damage. Recovery from arthroscopic surgery is generally faster than from open joint surgery.  Lastly, a thorough analysis of the joint symptoms - their location, duration, and character, along with the physical appearance of the joints, assists in the diagnosis.

This is attributed to the inflammation causing skin and joint symptoms, which may also impact the brain and nervous system. The neurological conditions associated with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis encompass migraines, seizures, stroke, multiple sclerosis, restless leg syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, fibromyalgia, and other pain disorders. Psychiatric conditions linked include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, cognitive issues, personality disorders, sexual disorders, sleep disorders, eating disorders, and schizophrenia.   Inflammation from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis can lead to fatigue, brain fog, stroke, and migraine by damaging vessels supplying blood to the brain.

It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the fluid in our joints, causing inflammation and pain. The chances of getting RA can be influenced by factors such as gender, age, and lifestyle.   Women have a higher chance of getting RA than men. The disease is also more common as people age, with most people developing it between the ages of 30 and 60. Some children can also get juvenile RA, but this is rare.  Smoking, obesity, and a diet high in calories and low in fiber can increase your risk of getting RA. However, consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may lower it.   If you have a parent or sibling with rheumatoid arthritis, you are more likely to get it. However, the disease isn't strictly inherited, as many people get it without a close family member having it.   There is no cure for RA, but treatments can help manage symptoms. Without treatment, RA can lead to disability and a reduced lifespan. However, if treatment starts within 6 months of symptom onset, there's a better chance of controlling the disease and reducing symptoms like joint swelling and tenderness.   In recent years, there have been changes in the types of RA observed. There's been a decrease in rheumatoid factor-positive RA and an increase in RF-negative RA, which is harder to diagnose and might affect treatment.

This can make an RA diagnosis more challenging, as it would have to be based on symptoms and other factors, rather than a blood test.  Being seronegative doesn't necessarily mean you don't have RA as 60% to 80% people with RA make RF and anti-CCPs, the antibodies associated with the disease. However, these antibodies can also be found in other diseases, so they alone aren't enough to confirm an RA diagnosis.  If you're seronegative and have symptoms of RA but your blood tests don't flag these antibodies, your doctor will likely recommend a physical exam and X-rays to look for inflammation and joint damage. They'll check for symptoms like joint pain or stiffness, red or swollen joints, and red or dry eyes.  Other conditions like osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis can cause similar issues, making seronegative RA harder to diagnose. Factors like smoking or obesity might also increase the likelihood of being seronegative.  Despite some believing seronegative patients have milder symptoms, RA affects everyone differently. One notable difference is that seropositive individuals often develop firm lumps near affected joints, which seronegative individuals generally don't.  Treatment for seronegative RA is similar to seropositive RA, with a focus on easing symptoms and preventing worsening of the condition. This is usually achieved through medications, physical therapy, exercise, and potentially surgery for joint replacement or reconstruction.   Being seronegative can make RA less predictable and harder to diagnose, potentially leading to delays in treatment. This delay might make it less likely for you to go into remission.

RA progression varies among individuals, with common patterns including long remissions (5-10% of patients), symptoms that come and go (15% of patients), and progressive RA, which necessitates long-term treatment and a coordinated medical team for management.   Four stages of RA have been identified. Stage 1 involves the inflammation of the joint lining (synovium) leading to swelling, stiffness, and pain. Stage 2, a moderate stage, sees the inflammation damaging the cartilage, resulting in decreased joint mobility. Stage 3, a severe stage, involves further cartilage erosion, bone damage near the joints, and the onset of deformities. Stage 4, or end-stage RA, is characterized by the cessation of inflammation, continued damage, joint dysfunction, pain, swelling, stiffness, lack of motion, and potentially the need for joint replacement surgery.  Treatment strategies differ based on the stage of RA. Early stage treatment primarily focuses on inflammation control using a low-dose steroid, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Moderate stage treatment may involve a combination of DMARD medications, stronger DMARDs, or a JAK inhibitor. Severe stage treatment may necessitate a different class of biologics or surgery, including joint replacement, joint fusion, or tendon repair.  The progression of RA can be determined by several indicators such as prolonged or intense flares, diagnosis at a young age, the presence of rheumatoid nodules, active inflammation in joint fluid or blood, radiographic damage at diagnosis, and high rheumatoid factor or citrulline antibody levels in blood tests.

Patients may experience frequent bowel movements, sometimes over 10 per day during flare-ups, which may contain blood and pus. The blood in stools is typically due to ulceration in the lining of the colon caused by frequent diarrhea or from anal fissures, which are tears in the anus lining.  The severity of UC can range from mild to dangerous. Mild attacks might involve several bowel movements per day with occasional blood in the stool, while severe flare-ups could mean six or more bowel movements per day with blood most of the time. Fulminant ulcerative colitis is an extreme form of the condition, wherein patients may pass more than 10 bloody stools in a day. It can lead to a life-threatening hemorrhage, necessitating urgent colectomy.  Patients should contact their healthcare providers immediately if they experience heavy and constant diarrhea, blood clots in stool, spiking fever, and severe pain. Emergency care is required for severe bleeding, fainting, and vomiting blood.   Treatment for UC includes anti-inflammatory drugs to manage bleeding. Anemia, a condition caused by excessive blood loss, affects about one-third of UC patients. It can be managed with iron supplements, dietary changes, or blood transfusions.   Anal fissures can be treated at home using high-fiber diets, sitz baths, increased water intake, and topical ointments. In severe cases, surgery might be necessary.   Up to a third of UC patients may require a colectomy if treatments fail or complications arise. The type of surgery would depend on the patient\u2019s age and health. Traditional surgery involves the removal of the colon and rectum and the creation of a stoma, or ileostomy. A more modern approach involves the removal of the colon but retains an internal pouch, thus preserving the bowel without the need for an external device.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on ulcerative_colitis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Data used in the study came from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which covers mostly white, well-educated individuals in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Hence, the data's applicability to the wider U.S. population may be limited. RA is twice as common in women, possibly due to the decrease in estrogen and progesterone as women age. No clear data is available regarding RA's impact on different racial and ethnic groups, except for certain Native American tribes, which have higher RA rates.  RA can occur at any age but is most common between 30 and 60. Although there is no cure for RA, about 20% of patients enter clinical remission and 75% have low disease activity or remission with medication. Early treatment, within six months of symptom onset, can reduce joint swelling and tenderness and improve outcomes. Without treatment, RA can lead to disability and death. Genetic predisposition plays a role in RA, but lifestyle factors such as diet, weight, and smoking are also significant contributors. High-calorie, low-fiber diets, obesity, and smoking increase the risk of RA, while omega-3 fatty acids may decrease it.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Psoriasis, characterized by patches of scaly, red, or white skin known as plaques, does not necessarily progress to psoriatic arthritis, a condition causing joint swelling and pain with potential for permanent damage. The commonality between these two lies in the immune system's maladaptive response, instigating inflammation and self-attack.  Approximately one-third of psoriasis patients may develop psoriatic arthritis, but the predictive markers are currently unidentified. Skin symptoms typically precede arthritis symptoms, but the latter can occur months or years before any dermatological manifestations, making early diagnosis challenging. Severe psoriasis may correlate with an increased risk of psoriatic arthritis.  Both conditions exhibit a pattern of flare-ups and remissions. A genetic predisposition is suggested by the fact that about 40% of psoriatic arthritis patients have relatives with either condition, although the specific genes remain unknown. Uncovering these genetic links could enhance prediction, prevention, and treatment strategies.  Contrarily, no links are found between the location of psoriatic plaques and the affected joints.

This form, which is a medical emergency, can cause rapid heart rate, abdominal tenderness, fever, high inflammation levels and anemia. It also carries the risk of developing a serious complication called toxic megacolon.  ASUC treatment involves hospitalization, hydration, and a series of tests. The most common treatment is intravenous steroid medications, but if these don't work within 3-5 days, doctors might use immunosuppressive drugs or even surgery to remove part of the colon (colectomy). It's worth noting that 30-40% of ASUC patients don't respond to steroid treatments and prolonged use of these medications can increase the risk of complications.   The disease commonly appears between ages 34 and 48, and men are at higher risk of needing a colectomy than women. Research suggests that 54% of those who developed ASUC get it within 1 year of their UC diagnosis.   The long-term outlook for ASUC is uncertain. There's a 20% likelihood of needing colectomy surgery after the first hospitalization, and this chance goes up to 40% after two hospital admissions.

It suggests seeking help when handling the disease becomes difficult alone. There are few types of help available. At home, one can use adaptive tools like rubber grips for jars and doorknobs, shower seats, raised toilet seats, or bathroom grab bars which can make daily tasks easier. If home solutions aren't enough, professional help such as occupational therapy and physical therapy can be beneficial. Occupational therapy teaches how to ease joint strain and introduces tools to make carrying or lifting things easier. Physical therapy involves treatments like hot and cold therapy, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, use of splints, or certain exercises to repair skills lost due to RA pain. These therapies can be accessed via a doctor's referral, local hospitals, home health centers, or community clinics. Adaptive tools can be bought from medical supply stores or online.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a normal person."}

As there are no lab tests for it, diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Other common symptoms include sleep problems, memory and concentration issues, anxiety or depression, morning stiffness, numbness and tingling in limbs, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, urinary problems, and painful menstrual cramps.   The pain experienced can be various types like deep, sharp, dull, throbbing, or aching and can come and go throughout the body. There are also specific tender points around the joints that hurt when pressed.   People with fibromyalgia often feel lingering tiredness and drained, like having the flu or missing a lot of sleep. They may also have problems with sleep, as their sleep is light and easily disturbed, leaving them feeling exhausted.   Up to half of all people with fibromyalgia have a mood disorder like depression or anxiety when diagnosed. This is likely due to dealing with chronic pain and fatigue.   Other symptoms include morning stiffness, resembling rheumatoid arthritis, and sensations of numbness, tingling, and burning. Many also experience frequent headaches, problems with urination, and unusually painful menstrual cramps.   In summary, fibromyalgia is a complex condition with a multitude of symptoms that affect various parts of the body, making it challenging to diagnose and manage.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a normal person."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/lupus/nutrition-lupus", "category": "arthritis", "perspective": "doctor", "summary": "doctor : The document provides various dietary recommendations for patients with lupus. Firstly, it suggests a well-balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, moderate amounts of meats, poultry, and oily fish to reduce inflammation, maintain strong bones and muscles, combat medication side effects, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce heart disease risk. Foods rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids like fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, nuts, and certain oils may help alleviate lupus symptoms by fighting inflammation.   However, alfalfa sprouts, garlic, and foods high in saturated fats such as fried food, commercial baked goods, creamed soups and sauces, red meat, animal fat, processed meat products, and high-fat dairy may cause inflammation and should be avoided. Lupus medications can cause weakening bones and folic acid loss, thereby requiring an increased intake of calcium, vitamin D, and folic acid through foods like low-fat dairy products, dark green vegetables, and fortified breads and cereals.   Additionally, small, frequent meals can help counteract medication-induced nausea and upset stomach. Strategies to lower blood pressure include consuming low-salt foods and fresh fruits and vegetables. For weight management, a low-fat diet and exercise program may be beneficial. Lastly, heart disease risk, which is higher in lupus patients, can be mitigated through a heart-healthy diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fish or fish oils.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/lupus/lupus-photosensitivity-uv", "category": "arthritis", "perspective": "patient", "summary": "patient : The document discusses Lupus, a condition where the patient may have a heightened sensitivity to sunlight, known as photosensitivity. Roughly two-thirds of people with lupus have this sensitivity and may experience an increase in symptoms after exposure to ultraviolet rays. This can result in skin rashes, fever, joint pain, and even inflammation of organs.  Each person's level of photosensitivity may vary. If you have lupus and find sunlight problematic, there are steps you can take to protect yourself. Try to avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UV rays are at their peak. Even on overcast days, you should take precautions as clouds don't completely block UV rays.  Sunscreen is crucial for anyone spending more than 20 minutes daily in the sun, but especially so for people with lupus. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to apply it to all exposed areas, including neck, back, and ears, and reapply every 2 hours.  Wearing protective clothing like hats with large brims, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants can also help provide coverage from the sun. If you're fair-skinned with light eyes and hair, you should be even more careful, as you're more sensitive to sun and artificial light.  Even indoors, UV rays can be a concern. Many offices and businesses use halogen and fluorescent light bulbs, and copy machines, which emit UV rays. Consider using shades, shields, filters, or tube covers to block these rays. Remember, windows do not offer full protection from UV rays, so consider using window shades or films that block UV rays.  Lastly, some medications can increase your sensitivity to sun or artificial light. Always consult with your doctor to understand if your medications have this side effect.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a patient."}

PsA causes inflammation primarily in joints but can also affect other body parts. Symptoms may mirror those of rheumatoid arthritis, necessitating diagnostic tests to confirm the condition.   PsA has several manifestations including swollen joints, fingers, and toes, which may become painful, puffy, hot, and red. Stiff joints, particularly worse in the morning, are common. Back and shoulder pain can result from inflammation in the joints of the spine and hip bones. Enthesitis, inflammation where a muscle connects to a bone, is also common, causing discomfort in activities like walking and climbing stairs. Manifestations can also include nail pitting, nail separation (onycholysis), chest and rib pain, and fatigue.  Moreover, PsA can increase the risk of other conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, depression, Type 2 diabetes, eye inflammation and vision problems (uveitis), gout, joint damage, and metabolic syndrome. Regular monitoring and proactive management are essential to mitigate these risks.   Patients with psoriasis should alert their doctor if they experience joint pain, as this could be indicative of PsA.

{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/ra-different-everyone", "category": "arthritis", "perspective": "patient", "summary": "patient : Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a condition where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body tissues, leading to joint inflammation and pain. The severity, progression, and symptoms can vary from person to person, depending largely on their genetic makeup. The three main types of RA are Seropositive, Seronegative, and Juvenile Ideopathic Arthritis.  Seropositive RA is diagnosed through blood tests that find substances called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides or rheumatoid factor, which cause RA symptoms. In Seronegative RA, these substances don't show up in your blood, so the diagnosis is based on other factors. Juvenile Ideopathic Arthritis affects people under 16 years old.  Common symptoms of RA include stiff, swollen and warm joints, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. Over time, RA might also affect your blood vessels, nerve tissue, bones, heart, kidneys, salivary glands, lungs, skin, and eyes. The intensity of symptoms can vary, with periods of worsening symptoms (flares) and periods of remission.  RA risk factors include age, gender (more common in women), family history, smoking, environment (exposure to certain minerals), and obesity. The exact cause of RA is unknown, but it seems to be related to your genes and possibly triggered by environmental factors like infections.  There is no cure for RA, but treatment can help manage symptoms. This includes medication like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for swelling and pain, corticosteroids to lessen joint damage, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs to slow down RA, and biologic agents for severe cases. Therapy, such as physical or occupational therapy, may also be beneficial. In severe cases where medication isn't effective, surgery might be suggested to alleviate pain and restore joint function. It's important to discuss with your doctor to determine the best treatment for your symptoms and type of RA.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a patient."}
{"document": "https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/seronegative-for-rheumatoid-arthritis", "category": "arthritis", "perspective": "doctor", "summary": "doctor : The document discusses seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition where a blood test does not detect antibodies typically associated with RA, making the diagnosis more challenging. Seronegative individuals do not commonly express rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs), which are found in 60%-80% of RA patients. However, these antibodies are also present in other diseases and thus, are insufficient for an RA diagnosis solely. The levels of RF and anti-CCPs can vary, and if they are very low, they might not be detected in a blood test, a state referred to as being seronegative. Diagnosis in seronegative patients relies on symptoms and may require physical examinations and X-rays to identify inflammation and joint damage.   Differential diagnosis is essential since other conditions like osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and others can cause similar symptoms. Notably, smoking and obesity may increase the likelihood of being seronegative. Seronegative patients do not typically develop rheumatoid nodules seen in seropositive patients and their symptoms can vary significantly.   The treatment approach for seronegative RA is similar to seropositive RA, focusing on symptom management and disease progression prevention. This includes medications, physical therapy, exercise, and possibly surgery. However, some research suggests that a small number of medications may not work as well for patients without detectable RF or anti-CCP antibodies.   The delay in diagnosing seronegative RA can result in treatment delays, potentially reducing the likelihood of achieving disease remission. Patients starting treatment within the first two years of symptom onset are more likely to achieve remission.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a doctor."}

Some people with RA can go for years without symptoms, while others experience symptoms that come and go. Most people with RA need a long-term treatment plan to manage the condition and prevent it from getting worse.  RA has four stages, each with its own treatment options. In the early stage, the lining of your joints becomes inflamed, causing stiffness and pain. The second stage involves inflammation damaging your cartilage, leading to stiffness and reduced movement. In the severe stage, inflammation wears away the cartilage, causing bone erosion, joint instability, deformities, pain, swelling, and loss of motion. In the end stage, inflammation stops but damage continues, causing joint dysfunction, pain, swelling, stiffness, and muscle weakness.   Treatment changes as RA progresses. In the early stage, the focus is on controlling inflammation to prevent joint damage. This might involve low-dose steroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain. In the moderate stage, you might need stronger medications or a combination of drugs. In the severe stage, biologics or surgery might be considered.  There are no easy ways to tell if your RA is getting worse, but flares that are intense or last long, active inflammation evident in tests, and damage on X-rays can be indicative. Early and aggressive treatment can increase your chances of remission.

Lupus increases the risk of heart disease and stroke due to long-term inflammation. It can cause inflammation of the heart, sac surrounding the heart, and the lining of the lungs, leading to pain and potential shortness of breath. Steroids, a common treatment for Lupus, may also increase these risks.   In the skin, Lupus can lead to sensitivity to ultraviolet rays, causing skin changes such as a butterfly-shaped rash, discoid lesions, and other skin problems like sores, hair loss, and Raynaud's phenomenon.   When it comes to kidneys, Lupus can cause inflammation leading to permanent damage, which can result in swelling in the legs and high blood pressure. In some cases, it can also lead to kidney failure requiring dialysis.   Lupus can impact the brain and central nervous system, causing symptoms like clouded thinking, confusion, memory loss, headaches, depression, anxiety, seizures, and rarely, strokes.   The most common eye problem associated with Lupus is dryness or a gritty feeling, but it can also cause damage to the nerves controlling eye movements and blood vessel changes in the retina leading to weakened vision.   Joint and muscle problems are common with Lupus, often causing pain, swelling, stiffness, particularly in hands, wrists, and feet, and muscle weakness.   Management strategies for Lupus include lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, regular exercise, healthy diet, up-to-date vaccinations, sun protection, gentle hair care, and stress management.

However, it's not the case for everyone.  There's a theory that psoriasis and celiac disease (a serious autoimmune disease triggered by gluten) might share common inflammatory and genetic pathways. People with psoriasis are three times more likely to get celiac disease. However, it's unclear how many people have both PsA and celiac disease, and more research is needed to understand this connection.  A large study found no direct link between gluten consumption and the diagnosis of PsA. Thus, it's unlikely that one can get PsA from eating gluten, and there's no evidence that avoiding gluten can prevent PsA.  That said, a gluten-free diet could reduce symptom severity in people with PsA who also have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or gluten intolerance. But this is not a recommended diet for everyone with PsA.  Both celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity are linked to gluten intolerance, but they are different. Celiac disease causes an abnormal immune response to gluten, leading to damage in the lining of the small intestine. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity means you get unpleasant symptoms when you eat gluten, but it doesn't trigger the same immune response as celiac disease, nor cause long-term damage.  If you're worried about gluten intolerance or have a close family member with celiac disease, you should consult a gut specialist or gastroenterologist. They may perform tests like blood tests, biopsies, genetic testing, or a gluten elimination diet based on your symptoms. However, you should check with your doctor before starting a gluten-free diet as it can be hard to know which foods to exclude and you may not get all the nutrients you need when you change your diet.", "instruction": "Summarize the following document on arthritis from the perspective of a patient."}
